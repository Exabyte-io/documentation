This section contains information about the general policies we use for data handling.

# Introduction

We subdivide the information that is processed and stored within our application into "structured" and "unstructured" first. 

For example, crystal structure data (eg. CIF/POSCAR files) uploaded into our platform is automatically processed and converted to a structured JSON-based format. Unstructured data generated by simulation engines during calculation first resides on disk. 

# Structured data

Structured data is stored according to the Exabyte Data Convention (internal-only at the moment, available to interested parties on a case-by-case basis). [Structured](structured.md) section contains the explanation of the basics of the convention employed and the underlying classification.

# Non-structured data

[This](non-structured.md) section explains the policies employed for handling non-structural data.
