# Data

We introduce here the following important concepts which pertain to the **Data** stored on our database.

## Classification

Data is classified according to the rules outlined [in this page](classification.md).

## Lifecycle

We explain the lifecycle of the data [here](lifecycle.md), where special focus is put on how the data files stored on disk can then be represented and stored as objects in order to make them accessible to the Web Application.
