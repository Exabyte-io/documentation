# Data Classification

This section contains information about the general policies we use for data handling. We subdivide the information that is processed and stored within our application into "structured" and "unstructured" first. 

For example, crystal structure data (eg. CIF/POSCAR files) uploaded into our platform is automatically processed and converted to a structured JSON-based format. Unstructured data generated by simulation engines during calculation first resides on disk. 

## Structured data

Structured data is stored according to the Exabyte Data Convention (internal-only at the moment, available to interested parties on a case-by-case basis). The [Structured](/data-structured/schemas.md) section contains the explanation of the basics of the convention employed.

The following general classification criteria can be applied in the context of Structured Data. Additional criteria can be defined to further categorize the [entity Properties](../properties/classification.md).

### By domain

Firstly, we identify the domain of the data.

- **materials**: information uniquely associated with a certain [material](/materials/overview.md).
- **workflows**: information about a computational [Workflow](/workflows/overview.md) routine used to extract the data.
- **other**: any other information.

> NOTE: it is generally possible to disentangle the data about materials from that concerning the Workflow program that extracts the properties of such materials. The "Other" category exists for the limiting cases where such a distinction is problematic.

In general, the data pertaining to each of Materials and Workflows can be related together though the creation of a [Job](../jobs/overview.md). 

The diagram below shows an example of properties (P) associated with a Material (M) and a Workflow (W), and linked through a Job (J). As explained in the [Properties Classification page](../properties/classification.md), properties can be either Descriptive (D) or Characteristic (C), depending on whether they are fed into the Job as input or extracted from it as output respectively. This diagram also shows how, to each Material property, corresponds a numerical [precision](/methods/data.md) (Prec) resulting from the Workflow computation.

### By source

We further classify data into the following three main subtypes, distinguished by their source.

- **experimental**: obtained with experimental equipment.
- **model**: obtained using modeling (computational or analytical).
- **other**: data that cannot be classified according to any of the above.

### By publication status

When the data is first obtained it can be raw, or unprocessed. The opposite occurs when the data is assembled for a peer-reviewed publication, and was able to pass multiple filter channels.
 
- **raw**: directly obtained from the source.
- **published**: published in a peer-reviewed journal or analogs.

## Non-structured data

[This](/data-on-disk/overview.md) section explains the policies employed for handling non-structural data.
