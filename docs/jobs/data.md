# Structured Representation of Jobs

In order to organize and store the information about Jobs we employ [Exabyte Data Convention](/data-structured/overview.md), as explained in more details [elsewhere](/entities-general/data.md) in this documentation.

# Example representation

Below is an example JSON structured representation of a Job. It contains a single [Workflow](/workflows/overview.md) and one [Material](/materials/overview.md).

```json
{
    "name" : "Test Job",
    "version" : "0.2.0",
    "_material" : {
        "_id" : "FJHNZCixeNfopuLrA",
        "exabyteId" : "e3nJ9g7tLaARSA25g"
    },
    "workflow" : {
        ...
    },
    "compute" : {
        ...
    },
    "_project" : {
        "_id" : "ypijc9N27BixEpKfT",
    },
    "status" : "finished",
    "createdAt" : "2017-10-17T18:20:53.975Z",
    "updatedAt" : "2017-10-17T18:22:31.389Z"
}
```
