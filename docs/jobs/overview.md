We now review the concept of computational "Jobs" in our platform, which allow Materials and Workflows to be operated in conjunction with one another to produce a unified simulation task. 

# User Interface

Jobs are classed as an [entity type](/entities-general/overview.md) of their own. As such, they have corresponding [Explorer](ui/explorer.md), [Designer](/jobs-designer/overview.md) and [Viewer](ui/viewer.md) interfaces, with some distinct features from the [general case](/entities-general/ui/overview.md) as explained in their respective documentation pages.

# Data

The JSON representation for Jobs is explained [in this page](data.md).

# Projects

Jobs can collectively be grouped together into [Sets](/entities-general/sets.md), which in this context are referred to as **Projects**.

# Actions

Some actions pertain specifically to Jobs, and are introduced [here](actions/overview.md).
