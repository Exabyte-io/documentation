# Jobs-specific Actions

The following set of actions can be performed in the context of Jobs, starting from the corresponding [Explorer Interface](../ui/explorer.md). They complement the actions of general applicability [introduced elsewhere](/entities-general/actions/overview.md).

# Create

There are a few specific aspects of the general [Create](/entities-general/actions/create.md) action which are worth noticing, as explained [here](create.md).

# Purge

We explain what Purge means in the context of Jobs [in this page](purge.md).

# Run

Jobs can be [submitted](../status.md) to the cluster for execution following [these instructions](run.md).

# Terminate

Submitted Jobs can be terminated artificially by the user at any moment before their completion [in this way](terminate.md).

# Create / Delete Project

[This page](create-delete-project.md) describes how the user can create new [Projects](../projects.md).

# Move Jobs to Projects

We explain how Jobs can be grouped together in [Projects](../projects.md) folders [here](../projects.md).
