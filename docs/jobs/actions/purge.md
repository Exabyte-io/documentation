# Purge Job

Purge differs from the [delete action](/entities-general/actions/delete.md) in the following aspects: the job being purged is kept in the account-owned collection as opposed to being permanently deleted, however all superfluous simulation output files present under the [Files Explorer](/files/ui/explorer.md) are removed. 

By superfluous we mean all those output files which are not strictly necessary for visualizing and inspecting the physical results of the simulation. Examples may include, but are not limited to, the log files generated by the corresponding simulation [application](/applications/modeling/overview.md) employed in the Job under consideration.

The purge action is restricted to Jobs with a ["Finished" status](../status.md).

# Action

To purge a Job listed under the [Jobs Explorer](../ui/explorer.md), first [select it](/entities-general/actions/select.md) and press the "Purge" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-card-off zmdi-hc-border"></i> located in the top right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).

Alternatively, the same action can be performed under the [actions dropdown](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) of the item entry that needs purging.

# Animation

In the example animation below, we first navigate into the [Files Explorer](/files/ui/explorer.md) of a bandstructure calculation Job. We inspect the resulting list of files, and we then compare it with the same list after the purging operation.
