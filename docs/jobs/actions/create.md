# Create Job

The procedure for creating new Jobs mirrors [the general case](/entities-general/actions/create.md). The only difference is that the action has to originate from inside a [**Project**](../projects.md), by clicking on the "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-file-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> there. Attempting to perform the Create action directly from the main Jobs Explorer results in an error. The project from where the Job is created is where it will also be saved later.
 
This contrasts with other [entity types](/entities-general/overview.md), for which this action has to originate under the main [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of the entity itself. 

# Opening of Jobs Designer

Clicking "Create" will then take the user to the [Job designer page](/jobs-designer/overview.md), where new simulations can be conceived from start to finish.

Below, we first navigate to the [Projects Explorer](../ui/projects-explorer.md) starting from [Jobs Explorer](../ui/explorer.md). We then open the first listed project, and from there we create a new Job by opening [Jobs Designer](/jobs-designer/overview.md) with the "Create" button.
