# Create Job

The procedure for creating new Jobs largely mirrors [the general case](/entities-general/actions/create.md). The only difference is that the "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-file-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> has to be clicked upon under the [Project Explorer](../ui/explorer.md) interface, under its corresponding [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).
 
This contrasts with other [entity types](/entities-general/overview.md), for which this action has to originate under the [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of the entity itself. Attempting to perform the Create action from Jobs Explorer results in an error.

# Opening of Jobs Designer

Clicking "Create" will then take the user to the [Job designer page](/jobs-designer/overview.md), where new simulations can be conceived from start to finish.
