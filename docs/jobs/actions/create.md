# Create Job

The procedure for creating new Jobs mirrors [the general case](/entities-general/actions/create.md). The only difference is that the action has to originate from inside a [**Project**](../projects.md), by clicking on the "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o zmdi-hc-border"></i> located under its [dedicated page](../ui/projects-page.md). Attempting to perform the Create action directly from the main [Jobs Explorer](../ui/explorer.md) results in an error. 
 
This contrasts with other [entity types](/entities-general/overview.md), for which this action has to originate under the main [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of the entity itself. 

The project from where the Job is created corresponds to where it will also be saved later.

# Opening of Jobs Designer

Clicking "Create" as prescribed above takes the user to the [Job designer page](/jobs-designer/overview.md), where new simulations can be conceived from start to finish. 

# Animation

Below, we first navigate to the [Projects Explorer](../ui/projects-explorer.md) starting from [Jobs Explorer](../ui/explorer.md). We then open the first listed project, and from there we create a new Job by opening [Jobs Designer](/jobs-designer/overview.md) with the "Create" button.
