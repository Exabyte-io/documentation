# Terminate Job

Any Job which is currently running, and therefore is under the ["Active"](../status.md) status, can be terminated before its completion upon user intervention. This might be necessary in case an error was realized in providing input information to the Job, or in case of excessive consumption of computational resources.

This preliminary interruption can be performed at any time on an Active Job through the "Stop" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-stop zmdi-hc-border"></i> located under either the [actions dropdown](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) or [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) menus.

## Animation

In the example below, we terminate an active Job, and the status changes correspondingly.
