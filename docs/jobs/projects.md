# Projects

Jobs are organized into **Projects** for convenience, which represent a particular type of [Set](/entities-general/sets.md) exclusive to Jobs. One can thus think about projects as collections of jobs, in the same manner as a file system directory is a collection of files.

Projects can only be present at the top-level within their own [Explorer Interface](ui/projects-explorer.md), with no possibility of creating nested projects one inside the other. Here, they are labelled with their distinctive "folder" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-folder zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

# Create / Delete

The procedure for creating or deleting Projects under [Jobs Explorer](ui/explorer.md) is explained [separately](actions/create-delete-project.md).
