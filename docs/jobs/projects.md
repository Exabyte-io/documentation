# Projects

Jobs are organized into **Projects** for convenience, which represent a particular type of [Set](/entities-general/sets.md) exclusive to Jobs. 

One can think about projects as collections of jobs, in the same manner as a file system directory is a collection of files.

# Create / Delete

The procedure for creating or deleting Projects under [Jobs Explorer](ui/explorer.md) is explained [separately](actions/create-delete-project.md).
