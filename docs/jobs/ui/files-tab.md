# Files Tab

"Files" tab contains a list of all the files produced as part of the Job's computational tasks, both of input and output nature. This list is presented under the [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md). The files specific to each computing unit in the workflow are grouped together in different Folders, under the same name as the unit.

## Files Explorer

A review of the [actions](/data-in-objectstorage/actions/overview.md) and [user interface aspects](/data-in-objectstorage/ui/explorer.md) specific to the Files Explorer is offered in a separate section of the documentation.

## Example Appearance

An example of appearance of the Files tab is portrayed below, for a bandstructure run performed using the [VASP](/software/modeling/vasp.md) code. The user is referred to the [code-specific documentation](/software/modeling/vasp.md) for an explanation of the contents of the files displayed in this example.
