# Projects Explorer

The list of all [Projects](../projects.md) created under the Account is displayed in the dedicated Explorer, which has some distinct features from the [general case](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).

An example of appearance of Projects Explorer is shown below. The highlighted columns in the items list are the Project-specific ones. They are reviewed in turn in what follows.

# Project-specific Columns

## Number of Jobs

The total number of Jobs contained in each Project entry is indicated under the corresponding column, together with the subset of [active](../status.md) jobs. 

## Accounting Slug / CLI Path

These project features are reviewed [here](../projects.md#slug).
	
## Status

The status of the Project can have any of the badges listed [in this section](../projects.md#status).

# Open Projects Page

Project entries listed in Explorer can be [opened](/entities-general/actions/open-edit.md) for content inspection. This opens the corresponding Project page, which is documented [separately](projects-page.md).
