# Projects Page

The page dedicated to each [Project](../projects.md) contains the information about it and is comprised of two [main tabs](/ui/specific/tabs-navigator.md), as highlighted below.

# Jobs Tab

The list of Jobs contained in the Project is displayed under the "Jobs" tab, using the same interface as [Jobs Viewer](viewer.md), as shown in the above image. 

!!!note "Note: create new Jobs"
    The "Jobs" tab is where the action of creating new Jobs has to originate, as explained in a separate [documentation page](../actions/create.md).

# Overview Tab

Another tab labeled "Overview" is present next to "Jobs". Here, a summary selection of Project's properties is displayed, as shown in the example below. All such properties are also available under the main [Projects Explorer interface](projects-explorer.md).
