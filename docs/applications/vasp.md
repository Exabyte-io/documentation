# Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, better known as VASP, is a package for performing ab-initio electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics, using either Vanderbilt ultra-soft pseudopotentials or the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, together with a plane wave basis set. 

The underlying theoretical model is Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the code also allows for the use of post-DFT corrections, such as hybrid functionals mixing DFT and Hartreeâ€“Fock exchange, many-body perturbation theory (the GW method), and dynamical electronic correlations within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).

Complete information and documentation about the VASP code can be found in its corresponding [website](https://www.vasp.at/).
