# The Quantum ESPRESSO code

Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) is a software suite for ab-initio quantum methods performing general electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling. It is distributed for free under the GNU General Public License. Quantum ESPRESSO is based on Density Functional Theory, plane wave basis sets, and pseudopotentials (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft). 

The core plane wave DFT functions of QE are provided by the PWscf (Plane-Wave Self-Consistent Field) component. Further components are included in the distribution package, such as the Ph module for performing phonon calculations via the density functional perturbation theory and linear response theoretical formalisms.

Complete information and documentation about the QE software package can be found in its corresponding [website](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/).
