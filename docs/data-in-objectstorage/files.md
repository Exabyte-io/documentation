# Files

We organize our [simulation data](../data/overview.md) under **files** in order to interact and exchange information with the [simulation engine](../software/applications.md). We do this both for **inputting** parameters defining the nature of the simulation, and for [retrieving](../properties/lifecycle/retrieval.md) the **output** of the calculation upon its completion.

## Directory Structure

Files are distributed under a **Directory Structure** present within the [Storage Disk](../data-on-disk/directories.md) of the computing [infrastructure](../infrastructure/storage.md). 

This affords for the organization of files under a well-defined **hierarchic structure**, for their easier navigation, retrieval and inspection via [remote connection methods](../remote-connection/overview.md) for example.
            
## Object Storage of Files

If the Files need to be accessed from within the Web Interface instead, then it becomes necessary to **store them as Objects**. 

This object storage [^1] is a particular type of **storage architecture** that manages unstructured data as **Objects**, as opposed to other architectures such as the aforementioned hierarchical file systems. Objects represent in general the established way of accessing files from Web applications.
