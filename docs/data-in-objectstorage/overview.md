# Object Storage

In the present section of the documentation, we offer a general introduction to the concept of **Object Storage** for **storing** and **transferring** unstructured data, particularly the input and output files of simulations. 

The procedure of storing files data in the form of objects is necessary for making such data accessible under the Web Interface.

## Files

We provide a general introduction to the concept of Files as objects for storing data [here](files.md).
        
## Security

We review the security policies affecting object storage [in this page](security.md).
        
## Dropbox

The Dropbox utility for sharing files and data across the entire [infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview.md) of our platform is the object of a [separate discussion](dropbox.md).
        
## User Interface

The Files Explorer for navigating the files objects from within the Web interface is described [here](ui/explorer.md). 

Instances of this explorer interface can be found both under the [Dropbox page](ui/dropbox-page.md), and under the [Files Tab](../jobs/ui/files-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../jobs/ui/viewer.md).

## Actions

We introduce the actions available under the above-mentioned Files Explorer [in this section](actions/overview.md) of the documentation.
