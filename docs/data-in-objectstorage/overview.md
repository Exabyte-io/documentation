# Object Storage

In the present section of the documentation, we offer a general introduction to the **Object Storage** concept for **storing** and **transferring** unstructured data, particularly the **output files** of simulations. 

The procedure of storing data in the form of objects is necessary for making it accessible under the Web Interface, as "File" entries listed under the corresponding [tab of Job Viewer](../jobs/ui/files-tab.md). 

## Files

We provide a general introduction to the concept of Files as objects for storing data [here](files.md).
        
## Security

We review the security policies affecting object storage [in this page](security.md).
        
## Dropbox

The Dropbox utility for sharing files and data across the entire [infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview.md) is the object of a [separate discussion](dropbox.md).
        
## User Interface

The Filex Explorer for navigating the files objects from within the Web interface is described [here](ui/explorer.md).

## Actions

We introduce the actions available under the above-mentioned Files Explorer [in this section](actions/overview.md) of the documentation.
