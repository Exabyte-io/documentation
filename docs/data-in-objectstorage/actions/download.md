# Download Files

Files listed under the [Explorer interface](../ui/explorer.md) can be downloaded to the user's local hard drive as a personal copy. This is achieved by clicking the `Download` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-download zmdi-hc-border"></i> from either the [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) or the [actions drop-down](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown). Alternatively, files can be downloaded directly by clicking them.

## Animation

The animation shows how to download an example output file (named "OUTCAR") from within the entries listed under the Files tab of the corresponding [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md) interface.
