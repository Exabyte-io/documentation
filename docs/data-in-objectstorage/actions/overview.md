# Files Actions

We introduce here the relevant specific actions for managing [Files](../files.md) under the corresponding [Files Explorer](../ui/explorer.md) interface. These actions concern both the [input/output files of simulations](../files.md), as well as those stored within [Dropbox](../dropbox.md).
 
Performing these actions can be achieved from either the [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) or [actions drop-down](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) menus.

!!!note "Note: entity actions not applicable"
    The [general actions](../../entities-general/actions/overview.md) for entities are not applicable in the case of Files, except for the [Delete](../../entities-general/actions/delete.md) action.
    
## Copy Path

[In this page](copy-path.md), we explain how to copy the path of a file within the [directory structure](../../data-on-disk/directories.md) of the disk where it is stored.

## Download

Files can be downloaded to the local hard drive of the user's computer by following [these instructions](download.md).

## Upload

Conversely, local files can be uploaded to [Dropbox](../dropbox.md) as described [here](upload.md) to make them globally accessible throughout the entire platform. This action is not available in the context of simulation files listed under [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md).

## Create Folder

We explain how to create new folders for grouping files together [in this page](create-folder.md). Similarly to the previous "Upload" action, the "Create Folder" action is only available for [Dropbox](../dropbox.md).
