# Upload Files

Files originating from the user's local hard drive can be uploaded to [Dropbox](../dropbox.md) through the corresponding button <i class="zmdi zmdi-upload zmdi-hc-border"></i>, accessible from either the [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) or the [actions drop-down](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) of [Files Explorer](../ui/explorer.md).

!!!note "Note: uploading of files is only supported in Dropbox"
    The upload files action is not available for [Jobs Viewer](../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md), since in this case the user is not supposed to change the files contained there.

## Animation

Here, we demonstrate how to upload a "POSCAR" input file, containing the crystal structure data for performing a simulation using the [VASP](../../software-directory/modeling/vasp.md) engine.
