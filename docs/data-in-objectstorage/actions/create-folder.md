# Create New Dropbox Folder

New folders can be created under the [Files Explorer](../ui/explorer.md), in the context of the [Dropbox page](../ui/dropbox-page.md) exclusively. This functionality is convenient for organizing files for easier navigation and retrieval. It is not available with regards to the simulation files under [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md), since the user is not supposed to modify the structuring of the files listed there.

The creation of new folders is performed through the corresponding "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i>, located under the [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).

## Set Directory Name Dialog

Clicking this button opens the "Set Directory Name" dialog highlighted below, where the user can enter a unique name for the folder being created in the central text field. The `Submit` button at the bottom of the dialog should then be pressed to register the new folder under Dropbox. The user will now be able to [Upload](upload.md) new files from his local hard drive into this folder.
