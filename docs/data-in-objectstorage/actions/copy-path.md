# Copy Path of Files

The path of the file, within the [directory structure of the cluster](../../infrastructure/clusters/directories.md) where it is [stored](../../infrastructure/storage.md), can be **copied to the clipboard** through the corresponding `Copy Path` [dropdown button](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> under [Files Explorer](../ui/explorer.md).

Upon its copying, this path can be conveniently used in the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md) or [Remote Desktop](../../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md) environments for example.

## Animation

In the following animation, we demonstrate how to copy the path of a file to the clipboard. We then paste it in the [Web Terminal](../../remote-connection/web-terminal.md) with the help of the [Guacamole sidebar](../../remote-connection/actions/guacamole.md).
