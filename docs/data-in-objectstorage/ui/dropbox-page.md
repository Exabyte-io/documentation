# Dropbox Page

[Dropbox](../dropbox.md) has its own dedicated page within the Web Interface of our platform, which can be accessed via the [left-hand sidebar menu](../../ui/left-sidebar.md). The `Dropbox` option in this menu opens a file browser where one can navigate and edit files and directories.

Here, the files that are contained in Dropbox are presented under an [Explorer](explorer.md) interface with its associated [actions](../actions/overview.md), some of which (such as [Upload](../actions/upload.md)) are specific to Dropbox exclusively.

## Example Appearance

The Dropbox page has the typical appearance as illustrated below.
