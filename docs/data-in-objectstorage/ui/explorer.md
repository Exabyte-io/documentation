# Files Explorer

The Files Explorer interface displays a list of files in their [object](../files.md#object-storage-of-files) representation from within the Web Interface of our platform. The way files are presented to the user conforms to the general [Explorer conventions](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md). 

## Example Appearance

Files Explorer can be encountered under two circumstances: under the [Files Tab](../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md), and within the [Dropbox page](dropbox-page.md) accessible via the [left-hand sidebar menu](../../ui/left-sidebar.md). 

An example of its appearance in the former context is portrayed in the image below, where it displays both the input and output files of the corresponding [Job simulation](../../jobs/overview.md).

## Specific Features

Specific features of Files Explorer consist in the nature of the information displayed under the central table of the interface, as well as some of the [files-specific actions](../actions/overview.md) accessible from the corresponding [drop-down menu](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown).

Specific [table columns](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#columns-selector) include information on the **file size**, and on the **time and date** when the file was last **updated** (modified).
