# Adding Metadata to Entities

Metadata is a general concept in computer science which refers to data (or information) that provides information about other sets of data. Many distinct types of metadata exist, and in the context of the Exabyte platform they are used primarily to assist the user in retrieving certain desired entities from the various account-owned collections and repositories, by supplementing such entity entries with additional descriptive textual information. This metadata information can be added to an entity item in one or more of the following forms: 

## General description

In some cases, the user can add a general description of the entity's features and applications for reference purposes, which is to be entered in the Markdown scripting language [[1](#links)]. 

If no advanced text structuring or formatting needs to be performed as part of this description, then plain text can also be entered and no previous knowledge of the Markdown syntax is therefore required. 

## Tags

The user can furthermore add descriptive tags to the entity item being created or modified, in particular for easier retrieval of the item when general searches are performed across the Exabyte platform. Tags typically take the form of separate keyword text strings, that can each contain one or multiple words.

Tags can be entered on any appropriate dedicated tag text field one at a time, pressing the "Enter" key each time a new tag has been typed. Every time Enter is pressed, the corresponding tag badge will be included on the same line, with the option to delete it made available to its right through a click on the "X" symbol. 

An example of tagging process is shown in the animation below:

## Structural metadata for surfaces / slabs

A specific kind of metadata is present exclusively for slab / surface entries in the account-owned collection of materials. This metadata is needed specifically for performing surface energy calculations on such crystalline systems, and is elaborated further in the final section of the relevant [documentation page](../../materials-designer/header-menu/advanced/surface-slab.md).
