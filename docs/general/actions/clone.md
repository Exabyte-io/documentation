# Clone / copy entities

The cloning (or copying) of one or more entity items present in an account-owned collection into a new distinct entry can be achieved as follows: 

1. select one or multiple entity entries by ticking their corresponding checkboxes.
2. click the `Copy` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the actions toolbar at the top of the collection list.
 
Alternatively, this cloning operation can be achieved directly through the `Copy` option action under the three-dotted actions drop-down menu at the right-end of the entity entry line that needs to be copied.

# Cloned entity entry

## Finding cloned entry in the list

Once the copying operation is finished, a new separate entry with exactly the same content as the original will be generated and included in the collection list at the top (as the items in the list are sorted by the creation date by default). 

## Name of the cloned item

The initial name of this new clone entity always defaults to the original name with the string "(clone)" appended to it. 

# Animation

We demonstrate how to execute a simple instance of workflow cloning in the animation below, where we clone a newly-created workflow still labelled "Empty Workflow" into a new distinct entry directly above it in the account-owned workflows collection:
