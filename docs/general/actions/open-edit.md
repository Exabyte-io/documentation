# Opening and editing existing entities

The user might wish at some point to modify or simply consult an existing entity, which had been previously created (or imported from the corresponding Bank repository) and then saved to the appropriate account-owned collection.

# Opening an entity in the Designer interface

The user can choose any entity item listed in its collection page, and can then open it directly in the corresponding Designer interface to review and eventually bring changes to its computational parameters and overall structure. 

To open an entity, two equivalent approaches can be adopted: either the user can directly click on the name of the entity name towards the left-hand side of the corresponding entry line within the collection, or he can proceed via the `Open` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the actions drop-down menu button labelled with three vertical dots located at the right-end of the entry line that needs to be opened.

In either way, the final outcome will be the opening of the corresponding Designer interface displaying all the computational and/or structural parameters of the entity under consideration, for further inspection and modification.

# Animation

By way of an example, we demonstrate both ways of opening a workflow which already exists in the account-owned collection, and how to consequently view it on the Workflow Designer interface, in the animation below:
