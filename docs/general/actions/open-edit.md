# Open / View Entity

The user might wish at some point to view or slightly modify an existing entity, for example changing the associated [metadata](metadata.md). The `Open` action allows for that exactly.

# Edit Entity

The user can choose an Entity item listed in its collection page, and can then open in the corresponding [Designer](../overview.md#1-designer) interface to review and bring changes to it. 

# How to Open an Entity

To open an entity, two equivalent approaches can be adopted: either the user can directly click on the name of the entity in the [list](../overview.md#2-explorer), or use the `Open` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the actions [drop-down menu](../overview/#actions-dropdown).

# Animation

By way of an example, we demonstrate both ways of opening a workflow which already exists in the account-owned collection, and how to consequently view it on the Workflow Designer interface, in the animation below:
