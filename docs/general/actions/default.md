# Changing Default Entity

In order to change the default item out of a collection of entity items, the user has to click on the `Set default` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-star-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the three-dotted actions drop-down menu at the right-end of the entry line that needs to be defaulted. The user will recognize this choice as being the default entity for future operations by the check-mark assigned to it under the "Default" column of the collection interface. 

> NOTE: an entity item cannot be deleted from an account-owned collection for as long as it is set to be the default one. Only one entity at a time can be set as default in the context of a particular collection. 

# Animation

If we take workflows as our entity case study, then the setting of a new default entry in the account-owned workflows collection interface is performed as demonstrated in the animation below:
