# Searching for entities

Clicking on the `Search` button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the top-right actions toolbar of each collection page will activate a search bar at the top of the entity items list. Through this search bar, the user is then free to enter any text string to search for and retrieve any desired entry among those stored in the account-owned collection. 

Once the search string is entered, the search is then performed automatically by the interface, with no further action needed from the user.
 
To revert to the original complete items list once a search is completed, the search text string should be deleted. 

# Search Criteria

Such searches can be based both upon the entity's name, or the tags and other descriptive metadata that have been associated with it at the moment of the entity creation. In the case of Materials specifically, the material's chemical formula can also be searched for. 
 
# Animation
 
In the example below, we demonstrate how to search for all workflows among those present in our current workflows collection containing the keyword "band structure", upon entering this keyword string in the search bar at the top of the workflows collection page. Only one search result is returned in this particular instance, and the screen is then reverted to the original complete list of workflows after deleting the search string.
