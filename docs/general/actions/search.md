# Searching for entities

Clicking on the `Search` button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the actions [toolbar](../overview.md#actions-toolbar) activates a search bar. Through this search bar, the user is then free to enter any text string to search for a desired entry in the corresponding collection. Once the search string is entered, the search is then performed automatically, with no further action needed from the user. In order to revert to the original complete items list, the search text string should be deleted. 

# Search Criteria

Searches can be based both upon the Entity name, or the tags and other descriptive metadata that have been associated with it at the moment of the entity creation. In the case of Materials specifically, the material's chemical formula can also be used.

In the example below, we demonstrate how to search for all workflows among those present in our current workflows collection containing the keyword "band structure". We enter this keyword string in the search bar at the top of the workflows list. Only one search result is returned in this particular case, and the screen is then reverted to the original complete list of workflows after deleting the search string.
