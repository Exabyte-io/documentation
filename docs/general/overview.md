# Types of Entities

The user interface of the platform contains three main distinct classes of entities, each recognizable by its unique symbol illustrated next to each entry in the list below:

1. Materials <i class="zmdi zmdi-widgets zmdi-hc-border"></i>: crystallographic information about each material's structure.

2. Workflows <i class="zmdi zmdi-dot-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i>: set of computational operations applicable to different materials. 

3. Jobs <i class="zmdi zmdi-file zmdi-hc-border"></i>: execution of the computational task on a particular material-workflow combination to produce the corresponding results and output files.

Each one of these entities has its own dedicated tab within the general user interface of the Exabyte platform, as depicted in the image below:

Despite each one of these types of entities being in a class of its own, many equivalent attributes, interface components and action operations are shared between all three of them in the context of their respective tabs. These will now be reviewed in turn in the sections below, in separate dedicated documentation pages. 

# Actions common to all entity types

Numerous simple actions, such as changing the item's name or adding descriptive metadata text to it, are performed in exactly the same fashion within the Exabyte platform when dealing with the three above-mentioned classes of entities. Please click on the links below to access the documentation pages associated with each common type of action:

## Modifying Name

The name of each entity as presented in the corresponding general items list can be changed according to [these instructions](actions/name.md).

## Inserting Descriptive Metadata

Each entity can be adorned with descriptive metadata, in the form of text, tags and other formats, for ease of referencing and retrieval when performing general searches. We explain how to add such metadata [here](actions/metadata.md).

## Changing Default

In each account-owned collection, any item can be turned into the default entry of the collection as described [here](actions/default.md).

## Deleting Entities

The user can delete any entry from any collection by following the procedure outlined [here](actions/delete.md).

## Clone Entities

Each entry in a collection can also be cloned, or copied, as a new distinct entry in the collection following [these instructions](actions/clone.md).

## Open Entities

Opening an entity item in a collection list in order to edit its content can be achieved [as follows](actions/open-edit.md).

## Performing Searches

The user can perform general searches to retrieve particular entities stored on the respective collection through [this procedure](actions/search.md).


# Interface components common to all entity types

Each type of entity can be displayed and visualized with its corresponding graphical user interface. There exists several interface components, and some of their respective sub-components, which are common to all entity types, and these include the following: 

## 1. Designer

### Source Editor (which may contain a graphical Viewer)

### Items List Sidebar

### Header Menu

In the case of Materials for example, their own Designer interface has the following general appearance, where the instances of the above interface sub-components have been labelled correspondingly:

## 2. General Items List


Moreover, the General Items List has the following aspect within its own page, again for the example entity case of Materials:
