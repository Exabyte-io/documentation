# Support Widget

Clicking on the `Support` widget at the bottom-left corner of the User Interface will open the following dialog:

![support-widget](/images/support-widget.png "Support Widget")

# Support information to be provided

Here, the user is able to submit customized support requests for overcoming any encountered technical issue and difficulty. These will be promptly evaluated and resolved by the Exabyte Administration in the shortest delay possible, via a personal e-mail communication. For this reason, the user is kindly asked to provide his email address in the central text field of the widget, besides the question being posed. 

Optionally, the user's name can also be entered. Finally, the Support Widget offers the possibility to include up to five file attachments together with the message being sent, in order to further clarify the technical problem being discussed and facilitate its resolution. The Exabyte administration particularly recommends attaching screen cast recordings demonstrating the problem, as was encountered originally by the user.  

# Final Sending of the support request

Once the support request message and all the accompanying information have been entered in the corresponding fields of the widget, the message can be finally sent via email to the Exabyte support staff by pressing on the `Send` button at the bottom of the widget. Alternatively, the support widget can be minimized, and any of its message contents erased, by selecting the `Cancel` option, or equivalently by clicking on the horizontal bar minimization icon at the top-right corner of the widget.
