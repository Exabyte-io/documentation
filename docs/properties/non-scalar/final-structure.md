# Crystal Structure

A complete **crystal structure** [^1] is obtained when a [set of atoms](atomic.md), known as the **basis atoms** or **repeating unit**, are convolved with each one of the lattice points of the underlying [Bravais lattice](lattice.md). 

The image below outlines this procedure conceptually.
