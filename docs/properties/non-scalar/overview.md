# Non-Scalar Properties

The non-scalar properties which cannot be expressed as a singular numerical value occur most notably in the form of **Arrays** of numbers, including both **Vectors** and **Matrices**, and under the form of traceable **Dispersion Curves** which can be visualized graphically. 

We review these categories of non-scalar properties in the forthcoming sections linked below. [This page](../data/list.md) contains the [JSON schemas](../data/overview.md) and associated examples for each property described in the present section.

## Dispersion Curves

Examples of dispersion curves which are routinely encountered in materials science computations include those describing the [electronic bandstructure](bandstructure.md) and [phonon lattice vibrations](phonons.md) of the material. The [Density of States](dos.md) pertaining to both of these dispersion properties can also be calculated and displayed graphically. 

## Matrix Properties

An important Matrix-like property that can emerge from a Material computation is the [internal stress tensor](stress-tensor.md).

## Vector Properties

Vectors describe primarily those properties of the material related to its **structure**. For this reason, we have grouped such descriptive vector properties under three separate categories, in relation to each of the [Atomic](atomic.md), [Lattice](lattice.md) and [Crystal Structure](final-structure.md) aspects of the material's description. They are reviewed and described in their respective documentation pages.
