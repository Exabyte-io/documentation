# Array Properties

Important array-like properties that can emerge from a Material computation are the [internal stress tensor](tensorial/stress-tensor.md) and the [inter-atomic forces](tensorial/atomic-forces.md). The former is computed in the form of a matrix, whereas the latter is presented as separate vectors. One vector exists for each atom present in the structure, describing the net force acting upon it due to the bonding interactions originating from all other atoms.

# Dispersion Curves

Examples of dispersion curves which are routinely encountered in materials science computations include those describing the [electronic bandstructure](dispersion/bandstructure.md) and [phonon lattice vibrations](dispersion/phonons.md) of the material. The [Density of States](dispersion/dos.md) pertaining to both of these dispersion properties can also be calculated and displayed graphically. 

# Structural Properties

Descriptive Structural Properties pertaining to the individual [atoms](structural/atomic.md), to the [Bravais Lattice](structural/lattice.md), and to the overall [Crystal Structure](structural/final-structure.md) of the material under consideration are reviewed and described in their respective documentation pages.
