# Properties Viewer

The final results of [properties](../overview.md) can be inspected by the user under the interface of the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) within [Jobs Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md), after the results have been extracted from the output of simulations. 

We explain how each property is presented under such an interface in their dedicated documentation pages, introduced [in this part of the documentation](../../properties-directory/overview.md).
