# Properties Viewer

The final results of [properties](../overview.md) can be inspected by the user under the interface of the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) within [Jobs Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md), after the results have been extracted from the output of simulations. 

## Property Examples

We explain how each property is presented under such an interface in their dedicated documentation pages, introduced [in this part of the documentation](../../properties-directory/overview.md).

## Export as Images

The possibility to print or download the property graphs (for some of them) in different image formats is offered, under the button labelled with three horizontal bars at the top-right corner of the panel shown above.
