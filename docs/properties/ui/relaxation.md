## Volume Relaxation

![1 jobs results](/images/1_jobs_results.png "1 jobs results")

This bandstructure workflow starts with an initial structural volume [relaxation](/workflows/addons/structural-relaxation.md). The end results of this first calculation are shown in the above panel image, and include some of the materials properties explained [in this page](/properties/properties.md).

Judging from the negligible values of both the inter-atomic forces and internal stress tensor of the material, we conclude that the relaxation has been effective in this case.
