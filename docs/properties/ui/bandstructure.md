# Bandstructure

![4 jobs results](/images/4_jobs_results.png "4 jobs results")

The main electronic bandstructure calculation is then performed. The results are portrayed in the form of a dispersion curve covering the [desired path](/workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/important-settings.md) in the reciprocal space of the Brillouin Zone, with its corresponding Greek letter labels for special symmetry points. The energy vertical axis is scaled relative to the Fermi energy of the material (red dashed line), marking the highest occupied energy level.

The possibility to print or download the dispersion graph in different image formats is offered, under the button labelled with three horizontal bars at the top-right corner of the panel shown above.

### Band gap section

Numerical data about the size of the energy band-gap of the semiconductor is also displayed below the graph, in the "Band gap" section. This information is available for both the direct band-gap at the Gamma origin point, and for the indirect band-gap between the indicated valence and conduction k-points.

### Eigenvalues section

Finally, the list of energy eigenvalue solutions corresponding to each k-point eigenvector in the reciprocal path under investigation can be inspected by expanding the "Eigenvalues" section, using the three-dotted button at the bottom of the panel. Information about the weight, net electron spin, and electron occupation numbers for each solution is also included here.
