![5 jobs results](/images/5_jobs_results.png "5 jobs results")

A second graph displaying the final results for the computed electronic density of states [[1](#links)] is also presented. The possibility to print or download the graph in different image formats is again offered under the top-right button.

In this graph, the total density of states is marked by the black line. Individual contributions are labelled with different colors, as explained in the legend below the graph. The Fermi level is again set by the red dashed line.
