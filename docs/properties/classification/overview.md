# Properties Classification

Properties can be classified according to different criteria. We review such classification schemes separately under each of the specific contexts outlined below.

## General

Properties common to both [Materials](../../materials/overview.md) and [Workflows](../../workflows/overview.md) can be classified according to the definitions contained [in this page](general.md).

## Materials 

Materials properties are the object of a [separate treatment](materials.md).

## Machine Learning

Some additional specific classification terminology can be introduced when discussing Machine Learning, complementing the more general criteria mentioned above.
