# Properties Retrieval

Properties can be **retrieved** for inspection through any of the following interfaces.

## Web Application

Properties can be retrieved through our online portal as the output of [Jobs](../jobs/overview.md), or by inspecting the entries listed in the account-owned collection of [Materials](../materials/overview.md). The former option can be accessed under the [Results Tab](../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Jobs Viewer](../jobs/ui/viewer.md), whereas the latter is available under the [Properties Explorer](ui/explorer.md) interface. 

## REST API

We explain how to retrieve properties programmatically via the REST API in a [separate documentation section](../rest-api/overview.md). 

## Data on Disk 

Properties can also be retrieved directly from the simulation data files stored on the [cluster disks](../infrastructure/clusters/overview.md), as explained [here](../data-on-disk/overview.md).
