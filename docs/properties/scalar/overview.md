# Scalar Properties

The most significant **scalar properties** that can be computed on materials include their **Energy** and **Pressure**, including an estimate of the **total average internal force**. They are reviewed in their respective documentation pages linked below. 

We also explain how such results are presented to the user under the interface of the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) within [Jobs Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md), when results are extracted from the output of simulations. 

## Energy Types

We review the concept of **Total Internal Energy** of a solid [in this page](energies.md), particularly with regards to its main contribution originating from the chemical binding interactions present within the crystal structure. Here, we also touch upon the **Fermi Energy** notion relevant in the context of bandstructure calculations, together with the associated **Bang-gap energy** for the case of semiconducting or insulating solids.

## Energy Contributions

The list of individual contributions to the above-mentioned total energy of the material can also be displayed, as we explain [here](energy-contribution.md). The nature of these computed contributions, which are available for review, is typically dependant on the modeling software employed. 

## Average Pressure

We outline the concept of the average internal pressure of the material [under this section](pressure.md).

## Total Force

Finally, one additional important scalar quantity which is available for computation on our platform is the total average internal force, which is the object of [a dedicated discussion](total-force.md).
