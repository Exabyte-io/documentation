# Total Energy Contributions

The Total Energy of a Material introduced [in this page](energies.md) is itself comprised of several **Energy Contributions**, computed as part of any [Workflow](/workflows/overview.md) involving at least one basic "self-consistent field" (scf) total energy calculation. 

# Types of Contributions

The following types of energy contributions are commonly encountered in [DFT](/models/dft/overview.md) computations. The types of energy contributions included in the final results depend specifically on the modeling [application](/software/applications.md) employed, as explained in what follows.
