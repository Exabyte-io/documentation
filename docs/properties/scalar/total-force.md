# Total Force

The **Total Force** is also treated as a scalar [Characteristic](../classification/general.md) property, defined as the norm (or magnitude) of the net vector sum of the individual [atomic forces](../non-scalar/atomic.md), summed across all atoms present in the crystal structure under consideration.

This material property is displayed under the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md) as follows, in units of eV/Angstroms. It it also routinely computed as part of any total energy self-consistent field (scf) calculation.
