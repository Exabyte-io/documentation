# Materials Properties

This section explains the available Materials properties which are available to be calculated by computational [Jobs](/jobs/overview.md) on our platform. 

# Types of Properties

Each material property is reviewed and described separately in a [dedicated section](properties/overview.md) of the documentation.

We draw the following distinction when referring to materials properties, as introduced in the [following page](/data/convention/structured.md).

## Descriptive Properties

Descriptive (or Derived) properties include all those quantities which can be calculated immediately from a knowledge of the crystal structure alone, before the execution of any workflow computation. Examples include physical properties of the lattice such as the volume and density.

## Characteristic Properties

Characteristic properties on the contrary require the execution of a workflow in order to be computed, such as the total energy and internal stress tensor of the material.

# User Interface

Materials properties are presented in special panels within the user interface of the [Jobs Viewer](/jobs/ui/viewer.md), as described in [this section](ui/overview.md) of the documentation.
