# Materials Properties

This section explains our approach to organizing, storing and interacting with the properties of [Materials](/materials/overview.md). 

# Types of Properties

Each material property is reviewed and described separately in a [dedicated section](/properties/overview.md) of the documentation.

We draw the following distinction when referring to materials properties, as introduced in the [following page](/data-structured/overview.md).

# User Interface

Materials properties are presented in special panels within the user interface of the [Jobs Viewer](/jobs/ui/viewer.md), as described in [this section](ui/explorer.md) of the documentation.
