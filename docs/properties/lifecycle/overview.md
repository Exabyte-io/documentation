# Properties Lifecycle

## Extractors

Properties are extracted from the output of the Workflow simulations and presented to the user following the procedures and conventions outlined in [this section](extractor.md).

## Refinement

The raw extracted properties are subsequently refined and categorized in the database for a better understanding of their physical meaning and of their overall numerical precision. We explain how this refinement procedure is enacted [here](refinement.md). 

## Retrieval

Properties can be retrieved in multiple ways as explained [in this page](retrieval.md).
