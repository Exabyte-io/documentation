## Make a payment to credit your account balance

You can make a payment, and thereby credit your account, by clicking the large Plus icon in the top right. You will be shown an Add Credit window with some preset amounts, in order to quickly top-up your balance. You can also choose a different credit amount by clicking on the "Other Amount" button. Once you open this option you will be able to enter an amount into an input field (minimum payment amount is $50). The amount you choose to pay determines your service level.

<div class="warning">
<b><u>Auto-renew</u></b>. Payments are linked to service levels. Higher payments trigger greater levels of service and the perks that are included in your account. Each service level has a validity period for balances. In order that your service level is maintained we offer the option to auto-renew your service level, and balance, before the end of the Validity period. You will also be notified by email before the end of your validity period.
</div>

## Confirm payment

Click on Add Credit to confirm the request, once the charge is accepted by our payments provider your balance and service level will be updated immediately.

## Shortcut

You can also increase your balance at any time by opening the account navigation (click on the profile image in header) and click Apply Credit.
