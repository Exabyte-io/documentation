# Account: Settings & Profile

This section covers the pages related to user accounts and billing, which are found in the right hand sidebar. Open it by clicking on your user profile card in the header.

## Bio (profile)

This shows information about users, teams and organizations of which they form a part, and any recent work they have published. You can edit some of this information by using the Edit Bio button. We are currently planning a feature which allows users to set information as private or public, vote for this feature on our Trello Roadmap board.
