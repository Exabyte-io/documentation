# Account: Settings and Profile
When you register for Exabyte.io we open a personal account for you which is associated with a service level, and to which are attached your projects and files, balance and storage quota. Details about your account are available in your account page which is accessed by clicking the profile card in the header (to open the right hand navigation) and clicking Account. Your account is split into three tabs:

## Bio (profile)
This shows information about you, to which teams and organisations you belong and what you have recently worked on. This information is public for users on Promo service level. Higher service level users will also soon be able to mark this information private. We also have planned the ability to add a description and role to your account to share with other Exabyte.io users.

## Preferences
Here you can set some preferences for your account. We also have further features planned for this section.

+ **Clone Suffix**: This suffix is appended to each job that is cloned via the jobs list page. The default is "clone".
+ **Application Intro Tour**: This setting will enable/disable the user interface tour that is shown when you log in.
+ **SSH Keys**: Here you can add, remove and create SSH keys that will be associated with your account.

You can quickly add to your account balance, increase your quota and change service levels from this page.
