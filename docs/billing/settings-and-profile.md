When you first register with Exabyte.io we open a personal account for you. Your account has a service level, and serves as the owner of projects, jobs and files. Account also has balance and storage quota. Details about your account are available inside "Account" page which can be accessed by clicking the profile card in the header (to open the right hand navigation) and clicking <i class="zmdi zmdi-settings zmdi-hc-border"></i> **Account** after.

Your account is split into three tabs:

## Bio (profile)

This page shows information about you, to which teams and organizations you belong and what you have recently worked on. This can be set as private/public depending on your service level. Higher service level are able to make all information private. We also let users add a description and role to your account to share with other Exabyte.io users.
