Payments are linked to service levels. Higher payment amounts trigger greater levels of service and the associated benefits. To elevate the service level, therefore, you can simply make a payment above the threshold we wish to activate. We have made it simpler by using buttons that automatically select the payment threshold.

## Open your Account page

Open the Account navigation by clicking on your account profile card in the header, then select the <i class="zmdi zmdi-settings zmdi-hc-border"></i> **Account** menu item.

## Open Service Level tab

From your account page click on the <i class="zmdi zmdi-layers zmdi-hc-border"></i> Service Level tab.

## Upgrade to a new service level

Below the account balance and storage quota widgets are listed the Service Levels available to you. Your current service level is greyed out and has the word Current in the button. We placed the service levels beside each other so you can quickly compare which level might suit you best. If you wish to upgrade to another service level simply click on the Upgrade button in the plan you want.

## Make the payment to activate the service

In the same way as adding credit, you can select **Auto-renew**, in order to safeguard this level of service before the validity period expires. Click **Confirm** to make the payment and activate your new service level.
