# Increase your service level
Payments are linked to service levels. Higher payment amounts trigger greater levels of service and the perks that are included in your account. To increase the service level therefore we simply need to make a payment above the threshold we wish to activate. We have made it simpler by facilitating buttons that automatically select the payment threshold.

## Open your Account page
Open the Account navigation by clicking on your account profile card in the header, then select the Account menu item.

## Open Servive Level tab
From your account page click on the Service Level tab.

## Upgrade to a new service level
Below the account balance and storage quota widgets are listed the Service Levsl available to you. Your current service level is greyed out and has the word Current in the button. We placed the service levels beside each other so you can quickly compare which level might suit you best. If you wish to upgrade to another service level simply click on the Upgrade button in the plan you want.

## Make the payment to activate the service
In the same way as adding credit, you can select Auto-renew, in order to safeguard this level of service before the validity period expires. Click Confirm to make the payment and activate your new service level.
