# Shell Scripting

Our platform includes full support for **shell scripting** [^1], that is the insertion and execution of UNIX commands inside a program to be run by the [Unix shell](../../cli/environment.md#shell-type) as command-line interpreter. The version of shell scripting we support is 4.2.46.

Shell scripts can be edited directly via the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md), or alternatively entered within the [editor for the unit input templates](../../workflow-designer/unit-editor/input-templates.md) inside [Workflow Designer](../../workflow-designer/overview.md).

## Example

An example for running a [Quantum ESPRESSO](../modeling/quantum-espresso.md) job via [Command Line Interface](../../jobs-cli/overview.md) can be found inside [this tutorial page](../../tutorials/jobs-cli/job-cli-example.md#4.-combined-input-script).
