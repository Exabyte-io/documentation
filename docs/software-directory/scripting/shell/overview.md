# Shell Scripting

Our platform includes full support for **shell scripting** [^1], that is the execution of UNIX commands inside a program to be run by the [Unix shell](../../../cli/environment.md#shell-type) as command-line interpreter.

Shell scripts can be edited directly via the [Command Line Interface](../../../cli/overview.md), or alternatively entered within the [editor for the unit input templates](../../../workflow-designer/unit-editor/input-templates.md) inside [Workflow Designer](../../../workflow-designer/overview.md).

## Versions

The version of bash supported on our platform is 4.2.46.

## Example

An example for running a [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../modeling/quantum-espresso/overview.md) job through a shell script executed via [Command Line Interface](../../../jobs-cli/overview.md) can be found inside [this tutorial page](../../../tutorials/jobs-cli/job-cli-example.md#4.-combined-input-script).

## Data

We introduce the [structured representation](../../../data-structured/overview.md) for shell scripting [here](data.md).
