# p4vasp

p4vasp is a visualization suite for the [Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)](../modeling/vasp/overview.md). It contains an extensible Graphical User Interface framework, that can be used to view material structures, density of states, band-structures and more. It provides a Python library that simplifies the process of manipulation of the VASP input and output data, via the use of [Python scripts](../scripting/python.md).

More information about this tool can be found under Ref. [^1].
