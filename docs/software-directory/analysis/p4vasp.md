# p4vasp

p4vasp is a visualization suite for the [Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)](../modeling/vasp.md). It contains an extensible Graphical User Interface framework, that can be used to view material structures, density of states, band-structures and more.

It also provides a Python library that greatly simplifies the process of manipulation of the VASP input and output data, via the use of [Python scripts](../scripting/python.md). p4vasp utilizes many handy routines and objects, for example for creating 2D graphs, for data storage or for implementing simple matrix libraries.

More information about this visualization tool can be found under Ref. [^1].
