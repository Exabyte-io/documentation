# VMD

VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems, such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc., using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting. It is distributed free of charge as an open-source software.  

VMD may be used to view more general molecules or crystal structures, as it can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure. It can additionally be employed to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. 

We advise the reader to consult the official documentation [^1] for a complete review of the features included in the VMD visualization software.
