# Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, better known as VASP, is a package for performing ab-initio electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics, using either Vanderbilt ultra-soft pseudopotentials or the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, together with a plane wave basis set. 

The underlying theoretical model is Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the code also allows for the use of post-DFT corrections, such as hybrid functionals mixing DFT and Hartreeâ€“Fock exchange, many-body perturbation theory (the GW method), and dynamical electronic correlations within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).

Complete information and documentation about the VASP code can be found in its corresponding website [^1]. 

!!!warning "License Requirements"
    VASP is a proprietary software, and as such it requires a license in order to be operated. All users who would like to use this code are advised to send us a [support request](../../ui/support.md) so that we can check their existing licenses. For academic users, a free usage of VASP can potentially be negotiated. 

## Default settings

### Default Pseudopotentials

The list of pseudopotentials currently available on the VASP can be found in Ref. [^1] below. Our platform provides the files for 5.2 and 5.4 version by default.
