# CP2K

CP2K is a freely available program to perform atomistic simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and biological systems. It provides a general framework for different methods: density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW) via LDA, GGA, MP2, or RPA levels of theory, classical pair and many-body potentials, semi-empirical (AM1, PM3, MNDO, MNDOd, PM6) Hamiltonians, and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid schemes relying on the Gaussian Expansion of the Electrostatic Potential (GEEP).

The reader is referred to the CP2K official website [^1] for accessing the detailed instructions on its modes of operation.
