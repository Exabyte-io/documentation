# Libraries

We provide the following development libraries, accessible within the [Command Line Interface environment](../../cli/environment.md) of our platform through the loading of the corresponding [modules](../../cli/modules.md).

## Parallel Libraries

For managing massively parallel jobs via the Message Passing Interface (MPI), the options are Open MPI [^1] and the Intel MPI [^2].

## Mathematical Libraries

We provide further support for the Math Kernel Library (MKL) [^3] and OpenBLAS.
