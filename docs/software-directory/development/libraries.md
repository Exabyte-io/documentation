# Libraries

We provide the following development libraries, accessible within the [Command Line Interface environment](../../cli/environment.md) of our platform through the loading of the corresponding [modules](../../cli/modules.md).

## Parallel Libraries

For managing massively parallel jobs via the Message Passing Interface (MPI), the user can choose between **Open MPI** [^1], an open-source MPI library project, and the **Intel proprietary MPI library** [^2].

## Mathematical Libraries

We provide further support for the **Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL)** [^3], a library of optimized math routines for science, engineering, and financial applications. Core math functions include BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, sparse solvers, fast Fourier transforms, and vector math.
