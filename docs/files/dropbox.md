# Dropbox

Dropbox is a limited-capacity cloud-based data storage (see [data conventions](/data/convention/non-structured.md/#dropbox-directory)) accessible under the same filesystem path everywhere within our application. This menu item opens a file browser where one can navigate and edit (upload, download, delete) files and directories. This feature is particularly convenient for storing auxiliary simulations data (eg. pseudopotentials). The image below shows the general appearance of this Dropbox interface:
