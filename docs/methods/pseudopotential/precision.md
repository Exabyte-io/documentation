# Precision of Plane-Wave Pseudopotential Method

At present, we limit the estimation of the [numerical precision](../precision.md) of plane-wave pseudopotential computations to the following list of parameters, as contained within the [data structure](../data.md) for methods.

- Dimensions and shifts of the grid of k-points for [sampling the Brillouin Zone](../../models/auxiliary-concepts/reciprocal-space/sampling.md)
- [Plane-wave cutoff energy](parameters.md#wavefunction-cutoff)
- [Charge density cutoff energy](parameters.md#charge-density-cutoff)
