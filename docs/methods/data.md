# Structured Representation of Methods

In order to organize and store the information about [Methods](overview.md), we employ the **Exabyte Data Convention**, as explained [elsewhere](../data-structured/overview.md) in the documentation.

Below, the user can find an example JSON structured representation of a [Method](overview.md). The concept of **numerical precision** of [properties](../properties/overview.md) is further described [here](../workflows/data/subworkflows.md#precision).

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/workflow/subworkflow/model/method.json!}
```
