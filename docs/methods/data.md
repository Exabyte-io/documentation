# Precision Estimates

The precision is normally estimated based on the input parameters used in the simulation, such as the plane-waves expansion cutoff and size of the grid of k-points in [DFT computations](../models/dft/overview.md). This quality typically results in a given final precision in the desired property being sought, as can be measured by the relevant [convergence studies](../workflows/addons/convergence-algorithms.md).
