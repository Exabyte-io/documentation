# Precision

Since method is a numerical property, it has a certain **Numerical Precision** associated with it with regards to the [properties](../properties/overview.md) that it calculates, characterizing the degree of numerical approximation.

!!! note "Example Precision for a Model"
    If we use Newtonian mechanics as the model, then Precision would be limited by the numerical precision of the number format (eg. float/double) that we use while calculating `F = ma`.
