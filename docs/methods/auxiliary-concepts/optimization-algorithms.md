# Optimization Algorithms

Computational calculations such as [Structural Relaxations](../../workflows/addons/structural-relaxation.md) rely on special numerical algorithms for solving iterative minimization and optimization problems. These algorithms are often of **quasi-Newton** [^1] nature, a general class of methods used to either find zeroes (roots), or local maxima and minima, of functions. 

Commonly-encountered quasi-Newton algorithmic methods in problems of relaxation and optimization of material structures are for example the **Broyden Method** [^2], or the more advanced **Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm** [^3].
