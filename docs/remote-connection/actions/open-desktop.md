# Open / Close Remote Desktop

The [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md) connection method for accessing our platform is accessible under the corresponding `Remote Desktop` option available in the [right-hand sidebar menu](../../ui/right-sidebar.md) of the [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md).

The Remote Desktop can subsequently be closed by clicking the âœ• button at its top-right corner, which reverts the entire screen to its previous appearance. 

## Animation

We demonstrate how to open and then close the Remote Desktop in the below animation.
