# Open / Close Guacamole Sidebar

The Guacamole sidebar is and integral component of the **Apache Guacamole Server** [^1] employed in our platform for implementing the [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md) and [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) remote connection interfaces. This sidebar is particularly useful for **copying/pasting text** from both remote connection options into the **clipboard** for later use elsewhere, as explained [in this page](copy-paste.md). 

This sidebar is hidden until explicitly shown. On a desktop or other device which has a hardware keyboard, you can open the sidebar by pressing the `Ctrl+Alt+Shift` (Windows) or `Ctrl+Command+Shift` (Mac OS) keys combination, after opening either the [Remote Desktop](open-desktop.md) or [Web Terminal](open-terminal.md) interface. The sidebar will appear towards the left-hand side of either interface. If you are using a mobile or touchscreen device that lacks a keyboard, the user can also show the menu by swiping right from the left edge of the screen. To hide the menu, press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift`/`Ctrl+Command+Shift` again or swipe left across the screen. 

## Further Functionality

Further functionality offered by the sidebar, besides copying and pasting text into the clipboard, includes the following list.

* Navigating back to the home screen
* Uploading files
* Selecting alternative methods of typing or controlling the mouse, particularly for use on mobile or touchscreen devices
* Zooming in and out of the remote display
* Disconnecting from the current connection entirely 

The full Guacamole documentation can be accessed under Ref. [^2].

## Appearance

Here, we display an example screenshot of what this sidebar looks like when viewed within the wider [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) interface.
