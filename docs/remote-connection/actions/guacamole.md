### Terminal menu
The Termila menu is a sidebar which is hidden until explicitly shown. On a desktop or other device which has a hardware keyboard, you can show this menu by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift. If you are using a mobile or touchscreen device that lacks a keyboard, you can also show the menu by swiping right from the left edge of the screen. To hide the menu, you press Ctrl+Alt+Shift again or swipe left across the screen.

The menu provides options for:

* Navigating back to the home screen
* Reading from (and writing to) the clipboard of the remote desktop
* Uploading and downloading files
* Selecting alternative methods of typing or controlling the mouse, particularly for use on mobile or touchscreen devices
* Zooming in and out of the remote display
* Disconnecting from the current connection entirely
