# Open / Close Web Terminal

The [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) remote connection method for accessing the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md) of our platform is accessible under the corresponding `Terminal` option included in the [right-hand sidebar menu](../../ui/right-sidebar.md) of the [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md).

The Web Terminal can subsequently be closed by clicking the âœ• button at its top-right corner, which reverts the entire screen to its previous appearance.
