# Open / Close Remote-connection Sidebar

The [Remote-connection Sidebar](../overview.md#[remote-desktop](remote-desktop.md)), available under both the [Remote Desktop](open-desktop.md) and [Web Terminal](open-terminal.md), is hidden until explicitly shown. On a desktop or other device which has a hardware keyboard, you can open the sidebar within either remote connection interface by pressing the `Ctrl+Alt+Shift` (Windows) or `Ctrl+Command+Shift` (Mac OS) keys combination. The sidebar will consequently appear towards the left-hand side of the interface. 

If you are using a mobile or touchscreen device that lacks a keyboard, the user can also show the menu by swiping right from the left edge of the screen.
 
To hide the menu, press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift`/`Ctrl+Command+Shift` again, or swipe left across the screen. 

## Functionality

This sidebar is particularly useful for **copying/pasting text** from both the [Remote Desktop](open-desktop.md) and [Web Terminal](open-terminal.md) connection options into the **clipboard**, for later use elsewhere. The procedure to do so is explained [in this page](copy-paste.md). Further functionality offered by the sidebar includes the following list.

* Navigating back to the home screen
* Uploading files
* Selecting alternative methods of typing or controlling the mouse, particularly for use on mobile or touchscreen devices
* Zooming in and out of the remote display
* Disconnecting from the current connection entirely 

The full sidebar documentation can be accessed under Ref. [^1].

Here, we display an example screenshot of what this sidebar looks like when viewed within the wider [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) interface.
