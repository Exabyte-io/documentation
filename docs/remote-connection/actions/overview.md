# Actions for Web Terminal and Remote Desktop

In the present section of the documentation we explain the actions common to both the [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) and [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md) connection methods. In the latter case, some further [specific actions](../actions-rd/overview.md) also apply.
    
## Open / Close Web Terminal

We document how to open the [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) interface [in this page](open-terminal.md).

## Open / Close Remote Desktop

Similarly, the [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md) interface can be opened by following [these instruction](open-desktop.md).

!!!warning "Switching between RD and WT requires a 5-10 sec pause."
    In case the user needs to switch between either of the Remote Desktop and Web Terminal, it is usually necessary to wait for a few seconds before clicking the corresponding option on the user interface after closing the other one. This is due to the finite response time of the user interface.

## Open / Close Remote-connection Sidebar

The Remote-connection Sidebar available under both Remote Desktop and Web Terminal offers multiple convenient functionalities, which are reviewed [here](sidebar.md).

## Upload Local Files

We explain how to upload locally stored files to the Remote Desktop or Web Terminal under [this page](upload.md).

## Download Remote Files

Conversely, files stored remotely can be downloaded to the user's local hard drive by following [these instructions](download.md).

## Transfer Files via SCP

We explain how to perform file transfers via the [SCP protocol](../../remote-connection/ssh.md#transfer-files-with-scp), between user's local UNIX-based machines and our remote server, [with these instructions](../../remote-connection/actions/transfer-files-scp.md).

## Copy / Paste Text

Finally, we provide [these instructions](copy-paste.md) on how text can be copied and pasted into the remote connection interfaces, with the help of the above-mentioned [Sidebar](sidebar.md). 

## Access data in Web Platform

Finally, we review the procedure for exchanging data back and forth between the remote connection interfaces and the [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md) of our platform, through the use of [Dropbox](../../data-in-objectstorage/dropbox.md).
