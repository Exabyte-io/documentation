# Open Applications in Remote Desktop

Useful graphical analysis and visualization [software](../../software/overview.md) is available under the [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md) interface of our platform, accessible via the `Other` category under the top-left `Applications` menu of the interface (except for the [VMD](../../software/analysis/vmd.md) application, which is listed under the `Graphics` category instead of `Other`).

This set of software is particularly useful for graphically visualizing the crystal structures of the [materials](../../materials/overview.md) involved in simulations.

## Animation: Open Example Application - "VESTA"

Here, we show how to open the [VESTA](../../software/analysis/vesta.md) visualization software under Remote Desktop, by way of an example.
