# Directory Browsing in CentOS Linux

Directories can be browsed in the CentOS Linux distribution [^1] [^2] implemented in the [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md), under a standard files explorer interface based upon the GNOME graphical environment [^3]. A general review of the directory structure encountered under this environment can be found [in this page](../../data-on-disk/directories.md).

## Animation

In the following animation, we demonstrate how to navigate in and out of some directories present under the Remote Desktop interface, starting from the main [Home Folder](../../infrastructure/login/directories.md).

## Open Linux Terminal

Another Terminal interface can be found under Remote Desktop, as customarily included in all Linux Distributions. This Terminal effectively complements the functionality of our own [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md). It can be opened under the `Applications` menu accessible at the top-left corner of the Remote Desktop interface, under the sub-menu labelled `Utilities`, as explained in the animation below.
