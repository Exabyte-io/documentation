# Exabyte Platform via Remote Desktop

A graphical **Remote Desktop (RD)** environment is also available as an option for connecting to our platform. This type of connection is recommended to users who are not familiar with the [Command Line Interface](../cli/overview.md), or want to run graphical [applications](../software/overview.md) for, for example, visualizing the crystal structures output by simulations.

## Linux Environment

Our Remote Desktop environment is based on the CentOS Linux distribution [^1] [^2]. We further explain the directory structure implemented under the GNOME Desktop environment [^3] [in this section of the documentation](../data-on-disk/directories.md).

## Available Analysis Software

The set of **Analysis and Visualization Software** presented [here](../software/analysis/overview.md) is available under the Remote Desktop, in their Graphical User Interface versions. 

We explain how to open and launch such analysis software [in this page](actions-rd/open-app.md). An example of the appearance of the Remote Desktop interface is shown in the image below, where the [VESTA](../software/analysis/vesta.md) option under the corresponding access menu is highlighted.

## Open Remote Desktop

We document how to open the Remote Desktop environment, starting from the [Web Interface](../ui/overview.md) of our platform, [here](actions/open-desktop.md).

## Actions

Other useful actions for Remote Desktop are introduced [in this section](actions/overview.md) of the documentation.
