# Connect to Exabyte Platform via Remote Desktop

A graphical **Remote Desktop (RD)** environment is also available as an option for connecting visually to our platform. This type of connection is recommended to users who are not familiar with the [Command Line Interface](../cli/overview.md), or want to run graphical [applications](../software/overview.md) for, for example, visualizing the crystal structures output by simulations.

## Linux Environment

This Remote Desktop environment is based on the CentOS Linux distribution [^1] [^2].

## Available Analysis Software

The following set of **Analysis and Visualization Software** is available under the Remote Desktop, in their Graphical User Interface versions. The reader may click each entry listed below to be redirected to the software's corresponding documentation introduction.
