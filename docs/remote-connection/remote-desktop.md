# Exabyte Platform via Remote Desktop

A graphical **Remote Desktop (RD)** environment is also available as an option for connecting visually to our platform. This type of connection is recommended to users who are not familiar with the [Command Line Interface](../cli/overview.md), or want to run graphical [applications](../software/overview.md) for, for example, visualizing the crystal structures output by simulations.

## Linux Environment

This Remote Desktop environment is based on the CentOS Linux distribution [^1] [^2]. We further explain the directory structure present in CentOS, which is implemented under the GNOME Desktop environment [^3], [in this section of the documentation](../data-on-disk/directories.md).

## Available Analysis Software

The following set of **Analysis and Visualization Software** is available under the Remote Desktop, in their Graphical User Interface versions. The reader may click each entry listed below to be redirected to the software's corresponding documentation introduction.

| Analysis Software |  Version |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| [VMD](../software/analysis/vmd.md) | 1.9.3 |
| [XCRYSDEN](../software/analysis/xcrysden.md) |  1.5.60 |
| [VESTA](../software/analysis/vesta.md)  | 3.3.8 |
| [P4VASP](../software/analysis/p4vasp.md) |  0.3.30 |

We explain how to open and launch such analysis software [in this page](actions-rd/open-app.md). An example of the appearance of the Remote Desktop interface is shown in the image below, where the [VESTA](../software/analysis/vesta.md) option under the corresponding access menu is highlighted.

## Open Remote Desktop

We document how to open the Remote Desktop environment, starting from the [Web Interface](../ui/overview.md) of our platform, [here](actions-rd/access-webapp.md).
