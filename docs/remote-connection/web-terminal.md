# Command Line Interface via Web Terminal

Alternatively to [external SSH clients](ssh.md), the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../cli/overview.md) of our platform can also be accessed through the **Web Terminal (WT)**, incorporated within our [Web Interface](../ui/overview.md). In this way the user does not have to install any extra Software, beyond what is required to navigate to our website.

## Enter the Command Line Interface 

After entering the Web Terminal, the user is welcomed with the **splash welcome screen** under the resulting [CLI](../cli/overview.md), which is reproduced [here](ssh.md#enter-the-cli) for reference purposes. This screen already includes numerous useful instructions on how the CLI can be operated.

## Open Web Terminal

We explain how to open the Web Terminal [in this page](actions/open-terminal.md).
