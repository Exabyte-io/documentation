# Entity Sharing

Any type of entity (Materials, Workflows, Jobs and Projects) can be shared with other users according to various different levels of data accessibility. The sharing button <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-add zmdi-hc-border"></i> is located for each entity type under either the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/overview.md), or under the [actions drop-down menu](/entities-general/overview.md) at the right-end of each entry item in the entity collection list. 

# Sharing Settings

Clicking on the sharing button <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-add zmdi-hc-border"></i>, corresponding to a given selected entity item, will redirect the user to the "Sharing Settings" dialog, containing the component panels highlighted in the image below:

![Sharing Settings](/images/sharing-settings.png "Sharing Settings")

# Filter bar

The various sharing options available in the sharing settings menu can be filtered down to a narrower selection through the top filtering bar <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i>, which shares the same core functionality as  [search bars](/entities-general/actions/search.md) in general.

# Sharing Options

Different levels of data sharing privacy can be chosen from the left-hand sharing options menu via the ticking of their corresponding left-hand checkboxes, in order to apply them to the entity item under consideration. Multiple sharing options can be chosen simultaneously, or selected all together via the top (or bottom) checkbox.
 
Once the desired options have been ticked, the "Sharing Settings" dialog should be closed through the "X" button at the top-right corner to apply the changes and revert back to the account-owned collection screen. The entity will consequently appear labelled with a tick under the "Shared" column of the collection interface. 

These sharing options will now be reviewed in turn:

## Anyone with link

The "Anyone With Link" option <i class="zmdi zmdi-link zmdi-hc-border"></i> allows any user holding a copy of the shareable link to access the entity and the data associated with it.  

## Anyone on the web

Entities can also be shared on the public internet, and therefore be made retrievable through general search engines on the entire world wide web, with the  "Anyone on the web" option <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe zmdi-hc-border"></i>.

## Public (all Users)

If the user wishes the entity to be shared with all other Exabyte users, but at the same time prefers to confine its availability to within the boundaries of the Exabyte platform and not the entire public internet, then the "Public (all Users)" option <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i> can be suitably chosen.

## Organizational accounts

The possibility to share the entity with other members of an organization of which the user is member is also offered.  To achieve this, the complete list of organizational accounts available to the user is included within the Sharing options.


# Actions Toolbar

To each shared entity can be assigned certain permissions, that will affect the way that such an entity can be interacted with and manipulated by other users. These permission settings can be found on the top-right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/overview.md) or equivalently under each entry's right-hand [drop-down menu](/entities-general/overview.md), and include the following  types of permissions  (to be applied to all currently-selected public):

## Read Permission

To allow the share public to simply visualize the contents of the entity, without granting them the opportunity to bring about changes to this entity or execute any of its computational tasks, the "Read" <i class="zmdi zmdi-menu zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission option should be chosen and applied.

## Execute Permission

The "Execute" <i class="zmdi zmdi-play zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission on the other hand gives the members of the share public the possibility to execute the computational tasks associated with the entity under consideration.

## Edit Permission

The "Edit" <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission finally grants other users the possibility to make modifications to the entity being shared with them.

## Add other User Accounts

An additional feature offered by the actions toolbar is the possibility to add other Exabyte users to the list of sharing options on the left-hand side of the "Sharing settings" page. To achieve this, the "plus" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> should be clicked. The user will then be presented with a complete list of all Exabyte platform users, as shown in the examples below, where the total number of entities of each type created by each user is also indicated:

![List Accounts](/images/list-accounts.png "List Accounts")

Each or multiple users can be selected via their corresponding left-hand checkboxes, and then added to the Sharing options by clicking on the "Select Items" <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> button located at the top-right corner of the page, which will return the view to the main "Sharing Settings" page. User search functionality is provided by the top [search bar](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i>.

## Revoke Access

Conversely, any currently selected user account can be removed from the Sharing Options list by clicking on the "Revoke Access" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye-off zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the Actions Toolbar. 


# Permissions Summary

The central panel of the "Sharing settings" page offers a table summarizing the permissions, between "Read", "Execute" and "Edit", attributed to each entry in the Sharing Options list. A tick will appear when the corresponding permission has been activated for that particular entry.

# Animation

In the example below, we demonstrate how to share a Material entity, in the form of a crystalline sample of silicon, with other users informed about the shareable link, and with another specific user account called "Team Exabyte.io" imported purposely from the accounts list page. To both of these sharing options, read permissions are finally granted.

# Sharing information in left-hand sidebar

The left-hand items navigation sidebar of the User Interface, described separately [in this page](/ui/specific/left-sidebar.md), offers convenient central repositories of entities being shared for reference purposes.

## Accounts page

The complete list of user accounts opened in the Exabyte platform to date, already introduced previously in the present documentation page, is also accessible from the final section of the left-hand sidebar, under the option "Accounts" <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i>.

## Entities shared by other users

Under the "Shared with me" option <i class="zmdi zmdi-share zmdi-hc-border"></i> towards the end of the left-hand sidebar, the user will be able to inspect all the various entities that have been shared with him by other users. These entities are grouped according to their type, which can be selected by navigating through the tabs present at the top of the page. Each entry in the various collections of shared entities can be [opened](/entities-general/actions/open-edit.md) for inspection, or even edited and executed, depending on the permissions assigned to the present account by the originator of the share.

## Entities Shared Publicly

Finally, a complete list of all entities that have been shared publicly, and that are therefore accessible to all users of the Exabyte platform, can be retrieved under the "Shared publicly" link <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the left-hand sidebar, again subdivided into entity types which can be navigated through the top tabs of the page.
