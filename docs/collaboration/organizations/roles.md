# User Roles

The conduct of an Organization and of its members is typically governed through all, or some, of the following user **Roles** listed below:

## Owner

The User who initially created the organization will be automatically appointed as the sole **Owner** of that organization, which attributes to him certain administrative privileges over the other Users. The title of Owner is not immutable following the initial organization creation, rather it may be relinquished to other users, but in order to do that a special [request](/ui/universal/support.md) needs to be made to our support staff.

## Administrators

Such privileges can be shared  by the Owner with specially designated **Administrators** of the organization, of which there may be one or many. Administrators, just like the Owner, have full control over the organization to which they belong. For instance, they can manage users, projects, teams and jobs. The only difference between them and Owners concerns their inability to delete the Organization. 

## Regular Members

All other non-administrative users belonging to a certain organization are then classed as **Regular Members**, and they are managed by the Owner and Administrators with elevated privileges. 

## People

All the users who are member of an organization (both at a regular and administrative level) are collectively referred to as the **People** of the Organization. The People of an Organization and of its constituent teams are listed together under the corresponding [People Explorer Interfaces](../ui/people-explorer.md).

# Organizations vs Personal Accounts

The concept of Organization can be particularly appreciated when put in perspective vis-a-vis that of **Personal Account**, an alternative **type** of account associated with every user of our platform and created at the moment of registration. The user is by definition always the sole member of his own personal account, and he is consequently also the owner and principal administrator thereof.
