# Teams and Permissions

Teams are defined as distinct **groups of users** within an [Organization](overview.md). Members of the same Team share a common set of **[permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md)** for accessing entities that have been **[assigned](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md)** (or added) to that particular Team by the [Owner or Administrators](roles.md). 

# Teams Explorer 

Teams can be consulted and defined through the  Teams Explorer, introduced [in the following page](../ui/teams-explorer.md).

# Specific Pages

To each Team corresponds a dedicated page, as explained in [this section](../ui/team-pages.md).

# Entities

Entities of all possible [types](/entities-general/overview.md) can be assigned, or added, to members of a Team under a common set of [permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md). Only the Owner or Administrators of the parent Organization have the appropriate rights to perform such an action, and they should follow the instructions included [in this page](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md).

# Actions

A set of actions is made available to the Owner and Administrators to manage the various Teams, in relation to their membership, entity assignment and permissions. These actions are introduced [here](../actions/team/overview.md).
