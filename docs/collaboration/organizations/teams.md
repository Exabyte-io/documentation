# Teams and Permissions

Teams are defined as **groups of users** within an [Organization](overview.md). Members of the same Team share a common set of **[permissions](../../entities-general/permissions.md)** for accessing entities that have been **[assigned](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md)** (or added) to that particular Team by the [Owner or Administrators](roles.md). 

## Teams Explorer 

Teams can be consulted and defined through the  Teams Explorer, introduced [in the following page](../ui/teams-explorer.md).

## Specific Pages

Each team has a corresponding dedicated page, as explained in [this section](../ui/team-page.md).

## Entities

Entities of different [types](../../entities-general/overview.md) can be assigned, or added, to members of a Team under a common set of [permissions](../../entities-general/permissions.md). Only the [Owner or Administrators](roles.md) of the parent Organization have the appropriate rights to perform such an action, and they should follow the instructions included [in this page](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md).

## Actions

A set of actions is made available to the [Owner and Administrators](roles.md) to manage the Teams - their membership, entity assignment and permissions. These actions are introduced [here](../actions/team/overview.md).
