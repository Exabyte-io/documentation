# Teams and Permissions

Teams are defined as distinct **groups of users** within an [Organization](overview.md), who share a common set of **[permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md)** with regards to the various entities **[assigned](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md)** (or added) to that particular Team by the Owner or Administrators of the given Organization. 

Teams can thus be employed by the organization Owners and Administrators as a convenient management tool to create and manage permissions vis-a-vis the members of an Organization, and in particular to attribute to them specific access permissions to selected entity items.

# Teams Explorer Interface

Teams can be manipulated, navigated, and defined through the corresponding Teams Explorer graphical user interface, introduced [in the following page](../ui/teams-explorer.md).

# Team-specific Pages

To each Team listed under the above-mentioned Teams Explorer interface corresponds a dedicated page, with many features in common with the general Organization Profile page as explained in [this section](../ui/team-pages.md).

# Team Entities

Entities of all possible [types](/entities-general/overview.md) can be assigned, or added, to a Team and all of its members under a common set of [permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md). To do so, the Owner or Administrator of the parent Organization, who have the appropriate rights to perform such an action, should follow the instructions included [in this page](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md).

# Team Actions

Similarly to Organizations, a set of Actions is made available to the Organization's Owner and Administrators to manage the various Teams contained within the Organization, in particular in relation to their membership, entity assignment and permissions. These actions are introduced together in the following [section of the documentation](../actions/team/overview.md).
