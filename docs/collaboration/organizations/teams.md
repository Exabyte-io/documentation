Teams can let you create groups of members with similar interests for easier collaboration. You can use teams to give specific access (read or write) to projects.

# Creating a team

The following shows how to crate a team. A team consists of a group of organization members that have read or write access to projects associated with the team. The access permission (read or write) is set on team creation.

# Adding a project to a team

As it is already described, teams provide specific access (read or write) to projects associated with it. So at least one project should be added to a team. You can add a project to the team as follow:

!!! note "Access Project"
    When a project is added to a team, all team members are granted read or write access to the given project. Team members will be able to see (or edit in case of write access) jobs inside the project.

# Deleting a project from a team

A project can be removed from a team as follow:

!!! note "Access Project"
    When the project is removed from the team, none of the team members will be able to access the project, unless they are given access inside other teams. 

# Managing team members

The following shows how to add and delete team members:

!!! note "Team Members"
    You should add users to your organization (explained [here](overview#adding-a-member-to-organization)) before adding them to a team.
