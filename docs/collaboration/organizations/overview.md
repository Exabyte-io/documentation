Organizations are abstractions through which multiple users can collaborate. 

Owners and administrators can manage access for the members of organization to data and projects with comprehensive security and administrative features.

# Creating an organization

You can create an organization by clicking "Organization" link in the left sidebar:

As you can see there are different service levels for organizations, "Promo", "Enterprise" and "Enterprise Extra". "Promo" is the default organization service level with minimal set of features. For more information about service levels please visit [Service Levels](/billing/pricing-and-service-levels/).

# Adding a member to organization

In order to start sharing data and collaborating with colleagues, you should add users to your organization. When a user is added to the organization, he/she will by default be a read-only user which is only able to see the list of projects, people and teams.

Each organization have the owner and one or multiple admins. Admins have full control over an organization. They can manage users, projects, teams and jobs. The only difference between admin and owner is that an admin can not delete the organization. The following shows how to give user admin permissions.
