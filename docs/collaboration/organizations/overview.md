# Organizations

Organizations refer to **collaborative Accounts** comprising multiple **[Users](/accounts/users.md)**. They provide an environment for users to collaborate together, and to [mutually share](../sharing/ui.md) entities under the respect of a set of [permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md).

# User Roles

The various users belonging to an Organization can have different **Roles** attributed to them, as explained [here](roles.md).

# Teams

The Organization's members can be grouped together into **Teams**, which are the object of a [separate discussion](teams.md).

# User Interface

The list of all users and entities contained in an organization and its Teams can be viewed through the corresponding [components of the User Interface](../ui/overview.md).

# Organization Actions

Administrative actions which may need to be performed within an Organization are reviewed in a [dedicated section](../actions/organization/overview.md).
