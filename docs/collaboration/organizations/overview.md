# Organizations

Organizations, in the context of our platform, refer to **collaborative Accounts** comprising multiple **[Users](/accounts/users.md)**. Organizations provide an effective communitarian environment for multiple users to collaborate together, as well as [mutually share](../sharing/ui.md) data and entities through the platform network under the respect of a comprehensive set of [security and permission features](/entities-general/permissions.md).

# User Roles

The various users belonging to an Organization can have different **Roles** attributed to them, as explained [here](roles.md).

# Teams

The various members of an Organization can be grouped together into distinct **Teams**, which are the object of a [separate discussion](teams.md).

# User Interface

The list of all users and entities contained in an organization, as well as in its constituent Teams, can be viewed through the corresponding [components of the User Interface](../ui/overview.md).

# Organization Actions

All the necessary administrative actions which may need to be performed within an Organization are reviewed in a [dedicated section](../actions/organization/overview.md).
