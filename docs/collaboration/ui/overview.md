# Organizational Interface Components

When a user logs into our platform with an Organizational account, he/she will notice two additional tabs present under the ["Account Profile" page](../../accounts/ui/profile-page.md), labelled "Teams" <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts zmdi-hc-border"></i> and "People" <i class="zmdi zmdi-account zmdi-hc-border"></i>. These lead to the **Teams Explorer** and **People Explorer** interfaces respectively, through which the lists of Teams / People comprised within the parent Organization can be browsed.  

An additional **Team-specific Page** exists for each Team, listing all of its assigned People and Entities.

The access points to these three interface components are highlighted in the image below. Their respective documentation pages are referenced according to the same numbers.
