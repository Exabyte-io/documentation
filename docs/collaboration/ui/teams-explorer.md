# Teams Explorer 

## Open Teams Explorer

By clicking on the "Teams" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the Organization profile page, the user will be presented with the complete list of all [Teams](../organizations/teams.md) contained within the Organization under consideration, displayed in the standard [Explorer-type interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) commonly encountered across our platform.
 
An example of appearance of this "Teams Explorer" interface page is provided in the image displayed below:

## Central Table of Interface: Team Members and Projects

It can be noticed from the above image that, under each entry item among the list of teams, information about both the total number of team members and total number of projects assigned to each team is exhibited in the central table of the "Teams Explorer" interface. 

# Team-specific Pages

Team-specific pages for every Team contained in the Organization can be accessed by opening any entry listed under the Teams Explorer, as explained in [this page](team-pages.md).

# Create or Delete Teams

The action of creating or deleting Teams from the corresponding parent Organization, which can be performed by the organizational Owner or Administrators, is explained [here](../actions/organization/create-delete-team.md).
