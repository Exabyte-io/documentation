# Team-specific Pages

## Open a Team-specific Page

The user can try to [open](/entities-general/actions/open-edit.md) any team entry listed under the ["Teams Explorer"](teams-explorer.md) interface to which he has access. He will at this point be presented with the corresponding Team-specific page, under the same [Explorer-type interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md), as shown in the example below:

![Team Page](/images/team-page.png "Team Page")

## Team Summary

A summary of the Team's name, description and [permissions level](/entities-general/permissions.md) attributed to it at the moment of [Team creation](../actions/organization/create-delete-team.md) are clearly displayed at the top of the Team-specific page, as shown in the highlighted section of the example image above. This helps to remind the user that the page being currently viewed refers to that particular Team and not to the wider Organization.

## Tabs

### Entities Tabs

This Team-specific page lists all the entities [assigned](../actions/team/add-remove-entity.md) to that particular Team  under the tabs corresponding to each [entity type](/entities-general/overview.md),  accessible towards the top of the page as shown in the other highlighted section of the example image above. 

### People Tab

In addition, a complete list of all members of the Team can be viewed under the ["People" tab](people-explorer.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-account zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the Team-specific page. 

# Team-related Actions

Most Team-related Actions, such as adding or removing entities or members to the Team, can be performed (by the Organization Owner or Administrators only) within the realms of the Team-specific Page being presently discussed. Such actions are introduced [in the following page](../actions/team/overview.md).
