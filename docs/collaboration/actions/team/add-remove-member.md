# Add Members to Team

The Owner or Administrators of an Organization can add or remove members from the Organization's various constituent Teams in exactly the same fashion as the adding or removing of members in relation to the wider Organization itself, which is explained [separately](../organization/add-remove-member.md). 

!!!note "Note: Team Members"
    Any user that is wished to be added to a Team should first be made member of the parent Organization. 

## Open Team People Explorer

The only difference is that such a Team-targeted member addition has to originate from the [Team People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md) interface under the [Team-specific page](../../ui/team-pages.md), as opposed to the equivalent People Explorer interface under the parent Organizational profile page (the so-called "Organization People Explorer"). 

## Open Accounts Explorer and Add Users to Team

Starting from this point, the user is referred to the corresponding [Organization-related documentation page](../organization/add-remove-member.md/#open-accounts-explorer), under the same sub-headers, for an analogous explanation on how this addition or removal of members can be performed in the alternative context of Teams. 

## Animation

We will, in the following animation, start from the Account profile page of an Organization called "Exabyte.io", and we will then navigate to the Team-specific page of a "Test Team". In the end, we demonstrate how to add multiple new users to this Test Team from the Team's People Explorer interface:

# Remove Members from Team

Any Owner or Administrator can remove any other member from the Team contained in an Organization by first navigating to the [Team's People Explorer interface](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then following the [standard "Delete" procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md) for removing list entries from a general Explorer-type interface. 

It is worth noticing that, when a member is removed from the Team, he will no longer have access to any of the entities that were assigned to that particular Team, unless the same entities have been added to other Teams that the user is still member of.

## Animation

In the animation below, we remove the three members added in the previous animation from our "Test Team":
