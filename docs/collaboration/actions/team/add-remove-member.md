# Add or Remove Members in Team

!!! note "Team Members"
    Any user that is wished to be added to a Team should first be made member of the parent Organization. 

The Owner or Administrators of an Organization can add or remove members from the Organization's various constituent Teams in exactly the same fashion as the adding or removing of members in relation to the wider Organization itself. The only difference is that these actions this time have to originate from the [People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md) interface under the [Team-specific page](../../ui/team-pages.md), as opposed to the equivalent People Explorer interface under the parent Organizational profile page. Otherwise, the user is referred to the [Organization-related documentation page](../organization/add-remove-member.md) for an analogous explanation on how this addition or removal of members can be performed in the context of Teams.
