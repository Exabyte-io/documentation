# Add Members to Team

The  addition or removal of members from Teams is similar to the [equivalent procedure](../organization/add-remove-member.md) for the wider Organization. 

!!!note "Note: Team Members"
    Users that need to be added to a Team should first be made members of the parent Organization. 

## Open People Explorer

The user should start from the [People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md) under the [Team-specific page](../../ui/team-page.md). 

## Add Users to Team

At this stage, the user is referred to the [Organization-related documentation page](../organization/add-remove-member.md/#open-accounts-explorer) for an analogous explanation. 

## Animation

We start from the profile page of an Organization called "Exabyte.io", and we then navigate to the specific page of a "Test Team". In the end, we demonstrate how to add multiple new users:

## Remove Members

Members can be removed from a Team by first navigating to the [Team's People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then following the [standard "Delete" procedure](../../../entities-general/actions/delete.md). 

When a member is removed, he/she will no longer have access to any of the team's [assigned entities](../../organizations/teams.md#entities), unless available in other Teams.

## Animation

In the animation below, we remove the three members added previously:
