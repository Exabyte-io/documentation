# Assign Entities to Team

Entities of different [types](/entities-general/overview.md) can be assigned (or added) to members of a team under a common [set of permissions](edit-permissions.md). The procedure is explained in what follows:

## Open Entity Tabs

Starting from the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-pages.md), the user should [navigate](/ui/tabs-navigator.md) to the appropriate entity tab among the possibilities highlighted below:
 
![Team Entities](/images/team-entities.png "Team Entities")

## Open "Add Entity" page

The user should then click on the "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the top-right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). 

The list of entities that can be added to the team is now presented. 

## Add Entities

The desired entries can be selected by ticking their left-hand checkboxes, and finally added to the Team by clicking on the top-right `Select Items` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

## Animation

In the animation below, we add a material entity (crystalline silicon) to a "Test Team":

# Remove Entities

Any entity previously assigned to a Team can then be removed. Navigate first to the relevant entity tab under the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-pages.md), and then follow the general [Delete Procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md). 

When an entity is removed, none of the Team members will then be able to access it, unless they are given such permission inside other Teams. 


## Animation

We now proceed to removing the silicon material added in the previous animation:
