# Assign Entities to Team

All different [types of entities](/entities-general/overview.md) can be assigned (or added) to all members of a team simultaneously under a common [set of permissions](edit-permissions.md). The procedure for assigning entities to a team is identical for all entity types, and is explained in the following sections:

## Open Entity Tabs under Team-specific Page

Starting from the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-pages.md), the Owner or Administrator of the parent Organization, equipped with the appropriate privileges to perform such an entity-assignment, should then navigate to the appropriate tab corresponding to the entity type that needs to be added to the Team.
 
These tabs related to each of the possible entity types are highlighted in the image below within the wider interface of the Team-specific page:

![Team Entities](/images/team-entities.png "Team Entities")

## Open "Add Entity" page

Once the desired type of the entity that needs to be added to the Team has been selected from this list of tabs, the Organizational Owner or Administrator should then click on the "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the top-right actions toolbar of the resulting [Entity Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md). 

The list of entities that can be added to the team will now be presented, again under an [Explorer-type Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) called the "Add Entity" page. 

## Add Entities to Team

Under this "Add Entity" page, the desired entries can be selected by ticking their left-hand checkboxes, and finally added to the Team by clicking on the top-right `Select Items` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

## Animation

In the example animation below, we will add a Material entity consisting in crystalline silicon to a Team we Administer under the present Organization called "Test Team":

# Remove Entities from Team

Any entity assigned to a Team can be removed from the corresponding [Entity Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) by first navigating to the tab for that entity type under the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-pages.md), and then following the general standard [Delete Procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md) for deleting list entries from Explorer Interfaces. 

It is worth noticing that, when an entity is removed from the Team, none of the team members will subsequently be able to access that particular entity, unless they are given access permissions to it inside other Teams. 


## Animation

We will now proceed to removing the silicon material entity added to our "Test Team" in the previous animation:
