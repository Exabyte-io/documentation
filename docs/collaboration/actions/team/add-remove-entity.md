# Assign Entities to Team

Entities of different [types](../../../entities-general/overview.md) can be assigned (or added) to a team. The procedure is explained in what follows.

## Open Entity Tabs

Starting from the [Team Page](../../ui/team-page.md), [navigate](../../../ui/specific/tabs-navigator.md) to the appropriate entity tab among the ones highlighted below.
 
![Team Entities](/images/team-entities.png "Team Entities")

## Open "Add Entity" page

Next, click "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the top-right [actions toolbar](../../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). 

The list of entities that can be added to the team will now be presented. 

## Add Entities

The desired entries can be selected by ticking their corresponding checkboxes, and finally added to the Team by clicking `Select Items` button in the top-right <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i>.

## Animation

In the animation below, we add a material entity (crystalline silicon) to a "Test Team".

## Remove Entities

Any entity previously assigned to a Team can then be removed. First, navigate to the relevant entity tab under the [Team Page](../../ui/team-page.md), and then follow the general [Delete Procedure](../../../entities-general/actions/delete.md) to execute the removal action. 

When an entity is removed, none of the Team members will then be able to access it, unless they are given such permission inside other Teams. 

## Animation

We now proceed to removing the silicon material added in the previous animation.
