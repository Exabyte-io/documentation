# Edit Team Permissions

[Permissions](../../../entities-general/permissions.md) allow members of a Team to view and/or manipulate its  [assigned entities](../../organizations/teams.md#entities). Such permissions can be modified at any time after the [team creation](../organization/create-delete-team.md).
 
## Open Preferences tab 
 
First, navigate to the "Preferences" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> towards the right-hand side of the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-page.md):

![Team Preferences](/images/team-preferences.png "Team Preferences")

## The "Update Team Profile" Page

The user is greeted with the following page, containing the team information:

![Team Permissions](/images/team-permissions.png "Team Permissions")

### Update Team Permissions 

Multiple permissions can be selected simultaneously towards the bottom of the above page. Click `Update` button to save changes. The permissions summary displayed at the top of the Team-specific page will be updated accordingly.
