# Edit Team Permissions

The [permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md) attributed to the members of a Team by the Organization Owner or Administrators, for viewing and/or manipulating the various [entities assigned](add-remove-entity.md) to that given Team, can be modified at any time following the [Team Creation](../organization/create-delete-team.md)
 
# Open Preferences tab 
 
This can be done by first navigating to the "Preferences" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> towards the right-hand side of the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-pages.md). The precise location of this tab within the wider Team-specific page interface is highlighted in the image below:

# The "Update Team Profile" Page

Once this "Preferences" tab has been clicked upon, the Owner or Administrator of the parent Organization will be greeted with the following "Update Team Profile" page. The Owner or Administrator might remember inserting the team-related information contained in this page at the moment of [Team Creation](../organization/create-delete-team.md):

![Team Permissions](/images/team-permissions.png "Team Permissions")

## Update Team Permissions 

Towards the bottom of this page, multiple permissions can be selected simultaneously and assigned to the Team under consideration (overriding any previous permission settings) via the final `Update` button. The permissions summary displayed at the top of the Team-specific page will, as a result, be updated accordingly. 

# Animation

Below, we start with a "Test Team" equipped initially with only "Read" permissions with regards to all entities assigned to it and its members, and change the permission preferences to include all four possible permission levels (Read, Edit, Comment and Execute) at the same time:
