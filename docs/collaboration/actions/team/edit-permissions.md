# Edit Team Permissions

[Permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md) allow members of a Team to view and/or manipulate its  [assigned entities](add-remove-entity.md). Such permissions can be modified at any time after [Team Creation](../organization/create-delete-team.md).
 
# Open Preferences tab 
 
First navigate to the "Preferences" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> towards the right-hand side of the [Team-specific Page](../../ui/team-pages.md):

![Team Preferences](/images/team-preferences.png "Team Preferences")

# The "Update Team Profile" Page

The user is greeted with the following page, containing the same information as that entered during [Team Creation](../organization/create-delete-team.md):

![Team Permissions](/images/team-permissions.png "Team Permissions")

## Update Team Permissions 

Towards the bottom of this page, multiple permissions can be selected simultaneously, and finally assigned to the Team via the `Update` button. The permissions summary displayed at the top of the Team-specific page is then updated accordingly. 

# Animation
