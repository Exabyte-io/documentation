# Add Members to Organization

In order to start sharing data and collaborating with colleagues, the Owner or Administrators should add users to their Organization. When a user is added to the Organization, he/she will by default be a read-only user which is only able to see the list of projects, people and teams. More information about entity-related permissions, and about Account-related Access Levels, is available [here](/entities-general/permissions.md) and [here](/collaboration/sharing/access-levels.md) respectively.

## Open Organization People Explorer

In order to add new members, the Owner or Administrator of the Organization should first navigate to the "People" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-account zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the Organization's main Profile page. Here, he will be presented with the Organization-wide [People Explorer interface](../../ui/people-explorer.md), allowing him to view all the current members of the Organization. 

## Open Accounts Explorer

The  "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the page, under the [Actions Toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of the People Explorer interface, should be clicked upon in order to access the complete list of users present across the entire platform. 

The layout of this list is similar to that of the general [Accounts Explorer](/accounts/ui/explorer.md), except that only personal Accounts are listed this time since Organizations cannot be added to other Organizations. 

## Add Users to Organization

Any desired number of users can be selected from this list by ticking their corresponding left-hand checkboxes, and then added to the Organization under consideration by clicking on the `Select Items` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the page. The selected users will now appear as Organization regular members under the People Explorer interface of the Organization.

## Animation

All the above steps for adding members to an Organization are summarized in the demonstration below, where we add three new random users to our Organization called "Example":

# Remove Members from Organization

Any Owner or Administrator can remove any other member from an Organization by first navigating to the [People Explorer interface](../../ui/people-explorer.md) of the Organization profile page, and then following the [standard "Delete" procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md) for removing list entries from a general Explorer-type interface. 

Once a user is removed from an Organization, he will no longer be able to access any data associated with the Organization itself.

## Animation

In the animation below, we remove the three members added in the previous animation from our "Example" Organization:
