# Add Members to Organization

In order to share data and collaborate with colleagues, users should be added to the Organization. Newly added users initially have restricted permissions which can be elevated or granted through roles and [teams](../../organizations/teams.md). Information about entity-related permissions, and account-related roles, is available [here](../../../entities-general/permissions.md) and [here](../../../collaboration/organizations/roles.md) respectively.

## Open People Explorer

In order to add new members, first navigate to the "People" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-account zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the Organization's  [Profile page](../../../accounts/ui/profile-page.md). Here, the corresponding [People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md) can be found, showing the current members of the Organization. 

## Open Accounts Explorer

Next, click "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right corner of the page, under the [actions toolbar](../../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar), in order to access the list of users of the platform. 

The layout of this list is similar to that of [Accounts Explorer](../../../accounts/ui/explorer.md), except that only users (or, equivalently, personal Accounts) are listed. 

## Add Users 

Any desired number of users can be selected by ticking their corresponding checkboxes. They can then be added to the organization by clicking `Select Items` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the page. Selected users will now appear as regular members.

## Animation

The above steps  are summarized in the demonstration below, where we add three new users to our organization called "Example":

## Remove Members 

Any member can be removed by first navigating to the [Organization People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then following the [standard "Delete" procedure](../../../entities-general/actions/delete.md). 

Once a user is removed, he/she is no longer able to access data associated with the Organization.

## Animation

In the animation below, we remove the three members added previously above:
