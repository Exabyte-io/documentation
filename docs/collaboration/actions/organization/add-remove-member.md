# Add Members to Organization

In order to share data and collaborate with colleagues, the Owner or Administrators should add users to the Organization.  Newly added users have initially read-only permissions, and as such can only see the list of projects, people and teams. 

Information about entity-related permissions, and about Account-related Access Levels, is available [here](/entities-general/permissions.md) and [here](/collaboration/sharing/access-levels.md) respectively.

## Open People Explorer

In order to add new members, the Owner or Administrator should first navigate to the "People" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-account zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the Organization's  [Profile page](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md). Here, the corresponding [People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md) can be found, showing the current members of the Organization. 

## Open Accounts Explorer

The  "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the page, under the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar), should be clicked upon in order to access the list of users of the platform. 

The layout of this list is similar to that of [Accounts Explorer](/accounts/ui/explorer.md), except that only personal Accounts are listed this time, since Organizations cannot be added to other Organizations. 

## Add Users 

Any desired number of users can be selected by ticking their corresponding left-hand checkboxes. They can  then be added to the Organization by clicking on the `Select Items` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the page. The selected users will now appear as regular members.

## Animation

The above steps  are summarized in the demonstration below, where we add three new random users to our Organization called "Example":

# Remove Members 

Any member can be removed by first navigating to the [Organization People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then following the [standard "Delete" procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md). 

Once a user is removed, he is no longer  able to access any data associated with the Organization.

## Animation

In the animation below, we remove the three members added previously:
