# Create Entities

Creation of a new entity under an organizational account is exactly the same as the [general procedure](/entities-general/actions/create.md), with a few specific aspects worth noticing below.

# Permissions

Any member of an Organization can create an entity of any [type](/entities-general/overview.md), as long as he/she has ["Edit" permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md) in at least one Team.

# Team Assignment 

Once created, the entity is then assigned to the teams that the user belongs to, including the read-only ones.
