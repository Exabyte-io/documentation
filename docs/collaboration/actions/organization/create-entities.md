# Create Entities under Organizations

The procedure to create a new entity under an Organization largely mirrors the [general procedure](/entities-general/actions/create.md), with a few specific aspects worth pointing out:

# Permissions

In general, any member of an Organization can create an entity of any [type](/entities-general/overview.md) under the corresponding Organization-owned Entity Collection, but in order to do that he needs to have ["Edit" permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md) in at least one of the Teams that he is member of. 

# Automatic Assignment to Teams

Once created, the entity will then be automatically assigned (or added) to ALL teams that the user belongs to, including those Teams in which the user has read-only permissions.
