# Create New Team 

## Open Teams Explorer

Creating a new Team within an Organization is performed in a similar way to the [addition of new members](add-remove-member.md), except that the starting point this time is the [Teams Explorer interface](../../ui/teams-explorer.md). 

## "Create New Team" Dialog

The Owner or Administrator should click on the  "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the page. He/she will be presented with the following dialog:

![Create New Team](/images/create-new-team.png "Create New Team")

## Enter Team-related Information

Firstly, the required information about the name and description of the new team should be entered in the corresponding text fields. 

## Entity-related Permissions

The adequate entity [permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md) can then be set under the bottom drop-down menu. They are granted to future team members in relation to [assigned](../team/add-remove-entity.md) entities. One or multiple permissions between "Read", "Edit", "Execute" and "Comment" can be selected in this way. 

These options can be modified at any moment following team creation  [as explained here](../team/edit-permissions.md).

## Finalize Creation

Once the required information has been inserted, the bottom `Create` button should be clicked. The new Team  appears as a new entry under Teams Explorer. The Owner or Administrators can now proceed to [adding new members](../team/add-remove-member.md) and [assigning new entities](../team/add-remove-entity.md).

!!!note "Note: Organization-wide visibility"
    The Team-related information is visible to all organization members.

## Animation

In the example animation below, we demonstrate how to create a new Team under the "Example" Organization  called "Test Team", to which we  grant "Read" permissions only:

# Delete Team 

Any team listed under the Teams Explorer can be deleted by the Organization Owner or Administrator following the [standard "Delete" procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md).

## Animation

We now show how to delete the  "Test Team" created in the previous animation:
