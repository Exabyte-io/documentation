# Create New Team in Organization

## Open Teams Explorer

The action of creating a new Team within an Organization is performed in very much a similar way to the addition of new members, except that the starting point should this time be the "Teams" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the Organization's main Profile page, leading to the [Teams Explorer interface](../../ui/teams-explorer.md). 

## The "Create New Team" Dialog

After clicking on the  "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of Teams Explorer, the Owner or Administrator of the Organization with the necessary rights to perform such an action will be presented with the following "Create New Team" dialog:

![Create New Team](/images/create-new-team.png "Create New Team")

## Enter Team-related Information

Under this dialog, the required information about the name and description of the new team should first be entered in the corresponding text fields. 

## Entity-related Permissions

The adequate entity-related [permission](/entities-general/permissions.md) levels should furthermore be set under the bottom drop-down menu, to grant all future members of this new team this level of permission when entities will eventually be [assigned](../team/add-remove-entity.md) to the team. One or multiple permissions between "Read", "Edit", "Execute" and "Comment" can in this way be selected and applied to the new Team being created. 

These options can later be modified at any point, ensuing the Team creation, by following [these instructions](../team/edit-permissions.md)).

## Finalize Creation of the Team

Once all the above-mentioned required information has been inserted in the "Create New Team" dialog, and the bottom `Create` button has been clicked, the new team will appear as a distinct new entry under the Teams Explorer interface. The Owner or Administrators of the Organization can now proceed to [adding new members](../team/add-remove-member.md) and [assigning new entities](../team/add-remove-entity.md) to this team.

!!!note "Note: Organization-wide visibility"
    All Team-related information inserted in the "Create New Team" dialog will be visible to all other organization members following Team creation.

## Animation

In the example animation below, we demonstrate how to create a new Team under the "Example" Organization, which we will call "Test Team" and to which we will grant "Read" permissions only:

# Delete Team from Organization 

Any team listed under the Teams Explorer interface can be deleted by the Organization Owner or Administrator following the [standard "Delete" procedure](/entities-general/actions/delete.md) for removing list entries from a general Explorer-type interface.

## Animation

We will now show how to delete the  "Test Team" created in the previous animation:
