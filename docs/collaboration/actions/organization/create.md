# Create an Organization

!!!note "Note: Sufficient Service Level required to perform this Action"
    Creation of an Organization requires an appropriate [Service Level](/pricing/service-levels.md). Moreover, each Organization should be created under a  **separate** Account.  


New Organizations can be created by first navigating to the [Account Switcher](/accounts/ui/switcher.md) under the [right-hand sidebar](/ui/universal/right-sidebar.md). Here, the user should then click on the "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner. 

# "Create New Organization" Dialog

At this stage, the following dialog appears:

![Create New Organization](/images/create-new-organization.png "Create New Organization")

# Enter Information

The user should enter the following set of information in the corresponding text fields:

- Name: the desired name of the new Organization being created (compulsory information).
- Email: the email address to be associated (compulsory information). 
- Description: a short descriptive text about the purpose and intended usage. 
- Web: the URL of any associated website.
- Location: geographical location information (if applicable).

!!!note "Further changes to information"
     The above pieces of information can be modified at any moment by editing the [Account profile information](/accounts/ui/preferences/profile.md) under the [Account Preferences](/accounts/ui/preferences-overview.md).

# Finalize Creation 

When the information has been duly compiled, the user should press the `Create` button at the bottom of the dialog, or `Cancel` to revert. This information can be retrieved under the "[Bio](/accounts/ui/bio.md)" section of the Account Profile page. 

A promotional message might appear at this stage, as explained below. After closing it, the user can see the new entry under the [Switcher page](/accounts/ui/switcher.md). 


# Promotional Offer

If this is the first time an Organization is created, a promotional message will appear. The benefits consist in 10 dollars that are offered as an initial [Account Balance](/accounts/balance.md), for running some preliminary tests.
 
 This promotion will expire within 30 days following the Organization creation, or once the Account Balance has been depleted by the user. Any further usage of the Organization to perform computational tasks will then require future [payments](/accounts/accounting/increase-balance.md) to be made to the Account Balance. 

# Ownership

The user who went through the above procedure for creating the new Organization in the first place is automatically  appointed as the Owner of the Organization.

!!!warning "Warning: change of Owner"
    It is not possible for Organization Owners to relinquish their title to other members for the moment. Please [contact us](/ui/universal/support.md) if you would like to appoint some other user as the Owner of your Organization.

 
# Animation

In the example demonstration shown below, we create a new Organization called "Example", coupled with some randomly assigned email address, starting from the Account Switcher page. Since other previously-created Organizations were already present under the Account Switcher Explorer interface ("Test" and "Exabyte"), no promotional message is shown this time:
