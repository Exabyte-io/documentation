# Create an Organization

New Organizations can be created by first navigating to [My Accounts](../../../accounts/ui/switcher.md) page using the [right-hand sidebar](../../../ui/right-sidebar.md). 

## Open "Create New Organization" Dialog

Next, click on the "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner. At this stage, the following dialog appears.

![Create New Organization](/images/create-new-organization.png "Create New Organization")

## Enter Information

The user should enter the following set of information in the corresponding text fields.

- Name: the desired name of the new Organization being created (compulsory information).
- Email: the email address to be associated (compulsory information). 
- Description: a short descriptive text about the purpose and intended usage. 
- Web: the URL of an associated website.
- Location: geographical location (if applicable).

!!!note "Further changes to information"
     The above pieces of information can be modified at any moment by editing the [Account profile information](../../../accounts/ui/preferences/profile.md) under the [Account Preferences](../../../accounts/ui/preferences-overview.md).

## Finalize Creation 

Once the relevant information is entered, press `Create` button at the bottom of the dialog, or `Cancel` to revert. This information can be retrieved under the "[Bio](../../../accounts/ui/bio.md)" section of the [Account Profile page](../../../accounts/ui/profile-page.md). 

A promotional message might appear at this stage, as explained below. After closing it, the user can see the new entry under the [Account Switcher](../../../accounts/ui/switcher.md). 

## Promotional Offer

If this is the first time an Organization is created, a promotional message will appear. The benefits consist in 10 dollars that are offered as an initial [Account Balance](../../../accounts/balance.md), for running some preliminary tests.
 
 This promotion will expire after 30 days, or once the Account Balance has been depleted. Any further computational tasks will then require additional [payments](../../../accounts/accounting/increase-balance.md). 

## Ownership

The user who performed the above steps is appointed as the [owner](../../organizations/roles.md) of the Organization.

!!!warning "Warning: change of Owner"
    Please [contact us](../../../ui/support.md) if a member other than the creator needs to be appointed as the Owner.

## Animation

In the demonstration below, we create a new Organization called "Example".
