# Create an Organization

!!!note "Note: Sufficient Service Level required to perform this Action"
    Creation of an Organization under our platform is subject to the requirement that an Account with an appropriate [Service Level](/pricing/service-levels.md) be employed. Moreover, one **separate** Account of the sufficient Service Level is necessary for creating each desired Organization.  


New Organizations can be created by first navigating to the [Account Switcher](/accounts/ui/switcher.md) under the [right-hand sidebar](/ui/universal/right-sidebar.md) of the wider interface. Here, the user should then click on the "Create" button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-right corner of the resulting Account Switcher Explorer Interface. 

# The "Create New Organization" Dialog

At this stage, the user will be confronted with the following "Create New Organization" dialog:

![Create New Organization](/images/create-new-organization.png "Create New Organization")

# Enter Organization-related Information

In the above dialog, the user should enter in the corresponding text fields the following set of information, as shown in the example lines contained above:

- Name: the desired name of the new Organization being created (compulsory information).
- Email: the main email address that will be associated with this new Organization (compulsory information). 
- Description: a short descriptive text about the purpose and intended usage of the new Organization. 
- Web: the URL of any website that may be associated with the new Organization being created.
- Location: information about the geographical location of the Organization (if applicable).

!!!note "Further changes to Organization Information"
    Following the Organization creation, any of the above pieces of information can be later modified at any point by reviewing and editing the [Account profile information](/accounts/ui/preferences/profile.md) under the [Account Preferences](/accounts/ui/preferences-overview.md).

# Finalize Creation of the Organization

Once all the above information has been duly compiled, the user should press the `Create` button at the bottom of the dialog to finalize the creation of the new Organization, or `Cancel` to revert. This Organization-related information can later be retrieved under the "[Bio](/accounts/ui/bio.md)" section of the Account Profile page. 

A promotional message might appear at this stage, as explained in the subsequent section of the present documentation page. Once this dialog has been closed, the user will be able to then see the newly created Organizational Account under the Explorer interface of the Account Switcher page. 


# Promotional Offer

If this is the first Organization being created by the user, he/she will be greeted with a message informing him about some special promotional benefits which we offer as part of the newly-created Organization. In particular, these benefits consist in 10 dollars that are offered as an initial [Account Balance](/accounts/balance.md) for the Organization, in the spirit of allowing the user to perform some preliminary tests and trial runs under his/her new Organization.
 
 This promotion will expire within 30 days following the Organization creation, or once the Account Balance has been depleted by the user. Any further usage of the Organization to perform computational tasks will then require future [payments](/accounts/accounting/increase-balance.md) to be made to the Account Balance. 

# Organization Ownership

The user who went through the above procedure for creating the new Organization in the first place will automatically be appointed as the Owner of the Organization.

!!!warning "Warning: change of Owner"
    It is not possible for Organization Owners to relinquish their title to other members for the moment. Please [contact us](/ui/universal/support.md) if you would like to appoint some other user as the Owner of your Organization.

 
# Animation

In the example demonstration shown below, we create a new Organization called "Example", coupled with some randomly assigned email address, starting from the Account Switcher page. Since other previously-created Organizations were already present under the Account Switcher Explorer interface ("Test" and "Exabyte"), no promotional message is shown this time:
