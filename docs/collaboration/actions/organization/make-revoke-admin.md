# Appoint Administrator

The Owner or any existing Administrators can elevate a Regular Member of the Organization to the role of Administrator. 

## Open People Explorer

The Owner/Administrator should first navigate to the Organization-wide [People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then open the [actions drop-down](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) at the right-end of the candidate member. 

## Make Member Admin

Here, the option `Make admin` <i class="zmdi zmdi-chevron-up zmdi-hc-border"></i> should be selected. The chosen member is consequently  appointed as a new Administrator, as indicated by the tick appearing under the "Admin" column of the central table.

## Animation

Similarly, any Administrator can have his title revoked through the `Revoke admin` <i class="zmdi zmdi-chevron-down zmdi-hc-border"></i> option under the aforementioned actions drop-down menu.

## Animation

Below, we revoke the title of Administrator to the same member considered in the previous animation:
