# Appoint New Organization Administrator

The Owner of an Organization, or any of its already-existing Administrators, can designate any Regular Member of the Organization as a new Administrator. 

## Open Organization People Explorer

To do so, the Owner/Administrator should first navigate to the [Organization-wide People Explorer interface](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then should open the [actions drop-down](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) at the right-end of the entry line corresponding to the member that needs to be elevated to the title of Administrator. 

## Make Member Admin

Here, the option `Make admin` <i class="zmdi zmdi-chevron-up zmdi-hc-border"></i> should be selected. The selected member will consequently be appointed as a new Administrator of the present Organization, as indicated by the corresponding tick appearing under the "Admin" column on the central table of the Organization People Explorer interface.

## Animation

In the example below, we will appoint a new Administrator to our Organization called "Example":

# Revoke Administrator

Similarly, any of the previously appointed Administrators can have his title revoked through the alternative `Revoke admin` <i class="zmdi zmdi-chevron-down zmdi-hc-border"></i> option under the aforementioned actions drop-down menu.

## Animation

Below, we revoke the title of Administrator to the same Organization member that had the title assigned to him in the previous animation, within the same "Example" Organization:
