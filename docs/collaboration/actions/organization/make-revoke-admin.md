# Appoint Administrator

Regular members can be elevated to the role of an Administrator. 

## Open People Explorer

First, navigate to the Organization-wide [People Explorer](../../ui/people-explorer.md), and then open the [actions drop-down](../../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) at the right-end of the candidate member. 

## Make Admin

Here, the option `Make admin` <i class="zmdi zmdi-chevron-up zmdi-hc-border"></i> should be selected. The chosen member is consequently  appointed as a new Administrator, as indicated by the tick appearing under the "Admin" column of the table.

## Animation

In the example below, we appoint a new Administrator to our Organization called "Example".

## Revoke Administrator

Similarly, any Administrator can have his title revoked through the `Revoke admin` <i class="zmdi zmdi-chevron-down zmdi-hc-border"></i> option under the aforementioned actions drop-down menu.

## Animation

Below, we revoke the title of Administrator to the same member considered in the previous animation.
