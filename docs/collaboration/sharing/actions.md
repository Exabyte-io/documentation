# Actions Related to Entity Sharing

The following actions can be performed with regards to the sharing of entities under the ["Sharing Settings" dialog](ui.md):

# Set Permissions

To each shared entity can be assigned certain **Permissions**, that will affect the way that such an entity can be interacted with and manipulated by other users. These permission settings can be found on the top-right [actions toolbar menu](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of the "Sharing Settings" dialog, or equivalently under each entry's right-hand [actions drop-down menu](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).
 
The types of permissions listed in the [following page](/entities-general/permissions.md) are included under both actions menus, and will be applied to all currently-selected Sharing Options.

# Add Other Accounts

An additional feature offered by the actions toolbar is the possibility to add other platform Accounts (of both personal and Organizational types) to the list of sharing options on the left-hand side of the "Sharing settings" dialog. 

## Open Accounts Explorer

To achieve this, the "Add" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> should be clicked. The user will then be presented with a complete list of all Accounts that exist on our platform, with a layout similar to that of the general [Accounts Explorer](/accounts/ui/explorer.md), as shown in the example image below. Here, the total number of entities of each type created under each Account is also indicated:

 Account search functionality is provided by the top [search bar](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 
 
## Select and Add Accounts to Sharing Options
 
 Each or multiple Accounts can be selected via their corresponding left-hand checkboxes, and then added to the Sharing options by clicking on the "Select Items" <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> button located at the top-right corner of the page. This will return the view to the main "Sharing Settings" dialog.

# Revoke Access

Conversely, any currently selected Account can be removed from the Sharing Options list by clicking on the "Revoke Access" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye-off zmdi-hc-border"></i> present in the Actions Toolbar, or under the Account's actions drop-down menu.

# Animation

In the example below, we demonstrate how to share a Material entity, in the form of a crystalline sample of silicon, with other users informed about the shareable link, and with another specific Account called "Team Exabyte.io" imported purposely from the accounts list page. To both of these sharing options, read permissions are finally granted:

# Apply Sharing Options to Entity

Once the desired Sharing Options have been ticked under the "Sharing Settings" dialog, the dialog should be closed through the "X" button at its top-right corner to apply the changes to the entity under consideration and revert back to the entity-type collection screen. 

The corresponding entity entry will consequently appear labelled with a tick under the "Shared" column of the central table of the collection's [Explorer interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).
