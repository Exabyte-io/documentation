# Actions Related to Entity Sharing

The following actions can be performed under the ["Sharing Settings" dialog](ui.md):

# Set Permissions

Shared entities can have **Permissions** assigned to them, that affect the way it can be interacted with by other users. Permission settings can be found on the top-right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar), or equivalently under each entry's right-hand [actions drop-down](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown). They will be applied to the selected Sharing Options.
 
The [following page](/entities-general/permissions.md) lists the available types of permissions. 

# Add Other Accounts

An additional feature offered by the actions toolbar is the possibility to add other Accounts (of both personal and Organizational types) to the list of sharing options. 

## Open Accounts Explorer

To achieve this, the "Add" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i> should be clicked. The user is then be presented with a list of all Accounts that exist on our platform, in a layout similar to that of [Accounts Explorer](/accounts/ui/explorer.md) as shown in the example below. Here, the total number of entities of each type created under the Accounts is also indicated:

![List Accounts](/images/list-accounts.png "List Accounts")

Accounts can be [searched](/entities-general/actions/search.md) through the corresponding bar at the top <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 
 
## Add Accounts to Sharing Options
 
 Each or multiple Accounts can be selected via their left-hand checkboxes, and then added to the Sharing options by clicking on the "Select Items" <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> button at the top-right corner of the page. This returns the view to the main "Sharing Settings" dialog.

# Revoke Access

Conversely, any selected Account can be removed from the Sharing Options by clicking on the "Revoke Access" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye-off zmdi-hc-border"></i> present in the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar), or under the [actions drop-down](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown).

# Animation

In the example below, we demonstrate how to share a Material consisting in crystalline silicon. We share it with other users informed about the shareable link, and with another added Account called "Team Exabyte.io". To both sharing options, read permissions are finally granted:

# Apply Sharing Options to Entity

Once the desired options have been made under the "Sharing Settings" dialog, changes can be applied by closing it and reverting back to the entity collection screen. 

The corresponding entity will appear labelled with a tick under the "Shared" column of the [Explorer interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).
