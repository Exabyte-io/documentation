# Account Access Levels

Different Access Levels can be granted to Accounts on our platform:

## Anyone with link

The "Anyone With Link" Level <i class="zmdi zmdi-link zmdi-hc-border"></i> allows any user holding a copy of the shareable link to access the entity and the data associated with it.  

## External (Anyone on the web)

Entities can also be shared externally on the public internet, and consequently be made retrievable through general search engines, with the  "Anyone on the web" option <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe zmdi-hc-border"></i>.

## Public (all Users)

If the user wishes the entity to be shared with all other users of our platform, whilst concealing it from the public internet, then the "Public (all Users)" option <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i> can be chosen.

## Individual Accounts

The possibility to share an entity within the realms of an Organizational Account (of which the user is member) is offered. Entities can also be shared between Personal Accounts.


!!!note  "Note: analogy with Google Drive functionality"
    Similarly to [Permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md), the Access Levels included on our platform mirror the functionality of Google Drive files and folders  closely [[1](#links)].
