# Entity Sharing

An entity item of any [type](/entities-general/overview.md) (Materials, Workflows, Jobs and Projects), assigned to a specific [Team](../organizations/teams.md) or belonging to the wider [Organization](../organizations/overview.md), can be shared with other users according to various different levels of data accessibility. 

The sharing button <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-add zmdi-hc-border"></i> is located for each entity type under either the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md), or under the [actions drop-down menu](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) at the right-end of each entry in the entity collection list. 

# The Sharing Settings Dialog

Clicking on the sharing button <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-add zmdi-hc-border"></i>, in relation to a given selected entity item, will redirect the user to the "Sharing Settings" dialog. This dialog contains the component panels highlighted in the image below, presented in a standard [Explorer-type Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md):

![Sharing Settings](/images/sharing-settings.png "Sharing Settings")

# 1. Filter bar

The various available Sharing Options can be filtered down to a narrower selection through the top filtering bar <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i>, which shares the same core functionality as [search bars](/entities-general/actions/search.md) in general.

# 2. Sharing Options

Different levels of data access can be chosen from the left-hand Sharing Options menu, via the ticking of their corresponding left-hand checkboxes, in order to apply them to the entity item under consideration. Multiple sharing options can be chosen simultaneously, or selected all together via the top (or bottom) checkbox.

These sharing options, referred to formally as **Access Levels**, are reviewed in a [separate page](access-levels.md).

# 3. Actions Toolbar

Different Actions can be executed in relation to the sharing of entities through the top-right [Actions Toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of the "Sharing Settings" Dialog. These are reviewed [separately](actions.md).


# 4. Permissions Summary

The central panel of the "Sharing settings" page offers a table summarizing the [permissions](/entities-general/permissions.md) attributed to each entry in the list of Sharing Options. A tick will appear when the corresponding permission has been activated.

 
# Other Sharing Information under left sidebar

The left-hand sidebar of the wider general User Interface of our platform, introduced previously [in this page](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md), offers convenient central repositories of entities being shared:

## Accounts Explorer

The list of Accounts opened on the Exabyte platform to date, already mentioned previously in the current documentation page, is also accessible from the [Accounts Explorer Interface](/accounts/ui/explorer.md), under the option `Accounts` <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the left-hand sidebar.

## Entities Shared by Other Accounts

Under the `Shared with me` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-share zmdi-hc-border"></i> towards the end of the left-hand sidebar, the user will be able to inspect all the various entities that have been shared with him/her by other Accounts. These entities are grouped according to their type, which can be selected by navigating through the tabs present at the top of the page. 

Each entry in the various collections of shared entities can be [opened](/entities-general/actions/open-edit.md) for inspection, or even edited and executed, depending on the permissions assigned to the present account by the originator of the share.

## Entities Shared Publicly

Finally, a complete list of all entities that have been shared publicly, and that are therefore accessible to all users of the Exabyte platform, can be retrieved under the `Shared publicly` link <i class="zmdi zmdi-accounts-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the left-hand sidebar, again subdivided into entity types.
