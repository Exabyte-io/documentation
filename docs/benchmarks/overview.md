# Benchmarks 

We have executed a series of benchmark test to assess the performance of the [computing clusters](../infrastructure/clusters/overview.md) offered as part of the [general infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview.md) of our platform. The outcomes of such benchmarks are introduced and referenced throughout the remainder of the present page.

## High Throughput Screening

The results of the high-throughput benchmark are presented [here](high-throughput-screening.md).

## Distributed Memory Runs

We have tested the performance and efficiency of our distributed memory system, and the results are discussed [under this page](distributed-memory.md).

## Vendor Comparison

We have performed a Cloud vendors performance comparison, as explained [here](vendor-comparison.md).

## High-Performance Linpack

The testing of calculations performed with the High-Performance Linpack library are the object of a [separate discussion](hpl-benchmark.md).

## 2018-11 HPL VASP GROMACS

We recently performed further benchmarking tests based upon the [VASP](../software/modeling/vasp.md) and [GROMACS](../software/modeling/gromacs.md) codes, and we have documented them [here](2018-11-12-comparison.md).
