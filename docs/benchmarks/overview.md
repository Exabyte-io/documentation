# Benchmarks 

We have executed a series of benchmark tests to assess the performance of the [high-performance computing nodes](../infrastructure/clusters/overview.md) offered as part of the [general infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview.md) of our platform. The outcomes of such benchmarks are introduced and referenced throughout the remainder of the present page.

## [High-Performance Linpack](hpl-benchmark.md)

Calculations performed with the High-Performance Linpack library are discussed [here](hpl-benchmark.md).

## [High-Throughput Screening](high-throughput-screening.md)

Example results of a high-throughput screening benchmark are presented [here](high-throughput-screening.md).

## [Cloud Vendor Comparison](vendor-comparison.md)

1. Preliminary tests of the performance and efficiency of the distributed memory calculations from 2016 are discussed [under this page](distributed-memory.md).

2. Additional tests performed around the same time are as explained [here](vendor-comparison.md).

3. 2018 Benchmarks for [VASP](../software/modeling/vasp.md) and [GROMACS](../software/modeling/gromacs.md), are documented [here](2018-11-12-comparison.md).
