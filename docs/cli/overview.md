# Introduction to the Command Line Interface

Users can log into the main Unix-based **Command Line Interface (CLI)** [^1] of our platform with any of the available [remote connection methods](../remote-connection/overview.md) (including the [Remote Desktop](../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md), which has its own incorporated Terminal application as explained [here](../remote-connection/actions-rd/browse.md#open-linux-terminal)). 

After logging in, the user is presented with the following **welcome screen** under the CLI interface, which includes some useful advices and instructions on how to operate the relevant commands.

We explain the resource management system in its [dedicated section](../infrastructure/resource/overview.md), the accounting, software modules and commands outlined in the above visual are explained in sections mentioned below.

## [Environment](environment.md)

We offer the possibility to customize the **Environment** of the CLI, including both the **shell type** and the **loading of Modules** (pre-defined codes that don't need recompiling).

Both forms of environment customization are explained under the same page, [accessible here](environment.md). 

## [Accounting](accounting.md)

We introduce the aspects of [Account management](../accounts/overview.md) relevant in the context of CLI [here](accounting.md).

## [Actions](actions/overview.md)

The set of actions that is available in the context of the CLI is introduced [in this section](actions/overview.md) of the documentation.
