# Introduction to the Command Line Interface

Users can log into the main Unix-based **Command Line Interface (CLI)** [^1] of our platform with any of the available [remote connection methods](../remote-connection/overview.md) (including the [Remote Desktop](../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md), which has its own incorporated Terminal application as explained [here](../remote-connection/actions-rd/browse.md#open-linux-terminal)). 

After logging in, the user will be presented with the following **welcome splash screen** under the CLI interface, which already includes numerous useful advices and instructions on how to operate the relevant commands.

## Environment

We offer the possibility to customize the **Environment** of the CLI, including both the **shell type** and the **loading of Modules** (pre-defined codes that don't need recompiling).

Both forms of environment customization are explained under the same page, [accessible here](environment.md). 

## Actions

The set of actions that is available in the context of the CLI is introduced [in this section](actions/overview.md) of the documentation.
