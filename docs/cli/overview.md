# Command Line Interface

Advanced users can request to access our compute platform via command-line interface (CLI) by contacting support team at support@exabyte.io. In order to deliver the best quality service, we make direct connection through command-line interface (and remote desktop) available exclusively to accounts with certain [subscription levels](/billing/pricing-and-service-levels/#service-levels), when long-term mutual commitment is established.

## In-browser terminal and ssh terminal

We provide a convenient way to connect to exabyte.io via command-line interface directly from within our web application. In order to do so you can open righ-hand sidebar and click "Terminal icon" as it is illustrated below:

In case you prefer standard secure shell terminal over web-based terminal, we support it as well. Each user has a single password associated with their login account on the web. As a new user, you are able to upload a public ssh key directly from your profile page. This key together with your username can be used to access computational resources via command line interface.

!!! warning "Do not share your keys"
    Sharing a corresponding private key with any third party is not advised. Anyone who is logged in using this key will have access to compute allocation registered under your username.

More information on how to login is available [here](login.md).
