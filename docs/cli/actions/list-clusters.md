# List and Check Status of Clusters and Cluster Nodes

The available [clusters and cluster nodes](../../infrastructure/clusters/overview.md) can be listed under the [Command Line Interface](../overview.md), and their statuses inspected, with the `exaclusters` and `exanodes` commands respectively. 

<!-- TODO
Mohammed should fix the implementation of these two commands to include an example of their output here
-->
