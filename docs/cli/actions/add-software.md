# Add New Software 

The user can compile new software on the [Command Line Interface](../overview.md) (CLI), after for example introducing some changes or patches to its features compared to their default versions. 

Special permission is however required to access the master nodes of our [computational clusters](../../infrastructure/clusters/overview.md) via CLI in order to compile such new software. This permission can be requested to the Exabyte administrators by following [these instructions](../../ui/support.md).

## Example: Compile a Modified Version of Quantum ESPRESSO

For example, the user might wish to re-compile a version of the [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software/modeling/quantum-espresso.md) simulation package which is different from the ones offered [by default](modules.md#list-available-modules) on our CLI. This new versions might also include modifications to the source code itself brought about by the user. We refer to the official documentation [^1] for instructions on how to compile Quantum ESPRESSO via CLI.
