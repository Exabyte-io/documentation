# Create Python Environment

Here, we explain how to use the **"virtualenv"** module [^1] within the [Command Line Interface](../overview.md) to assemble some commonly used python packages for materials science computations into a **virtual environment**. These packages include the **"pymatgen"**, **"pandas"** and **"atomic simulation environment (ase)"** libraries.

## How to Use Virtualenv

Virtualenv can be used by following the instructions presented in its official website [^1].

## Example Python Packages

We support the following python packages in our platform.

### Pymatgen

**Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen)** [^2] is a materials analysis code that defines core object representations for crystal structures and molecules, with support for many electronic structure codes. It is currently the core analysis engine powering the **Materials Project** [^3] online database of material structures. 

### Pandas 
 
**Pandas** is a python software library for data manipulation and analysis [^4]. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

### Atomic Simulation Environment

The **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)** is a set of tools and python modules for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations [^5].
