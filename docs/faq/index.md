# General

## What is exabyte.io?

Exabyte.io is the fastest way to design and discover new materials.

We believe that focusing on core materials science is the most effective way to speed things up. We merge together in a single environment: rigorous models, vast compute power, intuitive user experience and data management tools, in order to make your work on materials design highly efficient.

## Where does your name come from?

Exabyte is 2<sup>60</sup> bytes. Or 1 billion gigabytes. Or 1 million hard drives. Or 1 thousand datacenter storage units. It is a pretty big number and it illustrates well the complexity and scale of the problem we solve.

Rumor has that our founding team together with the leading minds in the field had figured out that after surpassing 1 exabyte of accumulated materials data computers will be able to run simulations without needing humans.

## Why are you doing this?

The world of today is broken. Humankind now faces global challenges too many to count. We exist to solve the most fundamental ones affecting all others. In our vision the world of tomorrow is created not through long and expensive physical tests by trial-and-error, but through fast, accurate and intelligent models.

## Why should I care?

Because you already know that the way materials design and discovery is done now is rapidly changing. There are multiple new initiatives started, you can feel that radical changes are soon to come and you want to be among the first to know about them.
