# Interactive viewer: the "Edit" features

The second `Edit` button under the interactive viewer gives you further manoeuvrability in graphically adjusting the positions of the atoms in the unit cell. You can, for example, first select a certain number of atoms with a rectangular selection window, and secondly rotate/translate them. You can finally inject or delete individual atoms at desired sites in the crystal structure with right or left-mouse clicks respectively.       


The animation below summarizes all the above features:
