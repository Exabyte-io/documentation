# Crystal Basis

The atomic basis of a Material's crystal structure can be edited and set by expanding the lower "Crystal Basis" section in the central panel of the Materials Designer. Expanding is achieved by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the section header. The reader who is unfamiliar with the fundamental notions of crystallography is referred to any of the introductory textbooks on solid-state physics [[1](#links)].

The appearance of the "Crystal Basis" editor inside the Materials Designer interface is shown in the figure below:

# Coordinate Units

The default representation of the atomic coordinates is in crystal (also commonly called fractional) units [[2](#links)]. You may edit the elements' chemical symbols and coordinates directly inside the corresponding text area, and the changes will be reflected in real-time in the graphical visualization of the crystal structure on the right-hand side of the interface. Click on "Cartesian Units" to convert atomic coordinates to Angstroms.

# Animation

Click on the animation below to see the above in action. Here for example we change the x-axis atomic coordinate of the second off-origin atom in the two-atom basis of crystalline silicon, and then convert these new modified coordinates to Cartesian units.
