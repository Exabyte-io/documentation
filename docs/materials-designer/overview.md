# What is Materials Designer?

 The Exabyte platform provides a graphical crystal structure viewer and builder which we refer to as the Materials Designer, and that will now be reviewed in detail. This designer essentially makes it possible to conceive and then save new crystal structures from scratch.  

Experienced computational material scientists will recognize many of the features included in this designer interface from the most commonly used crystal visualization software packages, such as VESTA [^1], VMD [^2] or XCRYSDEN [^3]. However, a comprehensive approach will be adopted in the forthcoming documentation pages to make sure that neophyte users are not excluded from embracing our platform. 

> "Note for command line users": VESTA is also supported in the remote desktop mode.

## Navigating to Materials Designer

In order to create a new material, one first needs to navigate to the "Materials" page using the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top right corner of the page. 

## Components of the Interface

The Materials Designer is structured into four main building blocks and has the typical initial default appearance as shown in the picture below, where the four main components are demarcated in red.  To access their corresponding documentation pages, please click on each component's red panel directly on the image:

When first opened, the page is initialized with the default material (FCC Silicon initially). Readers can learn how to set and adjust default materials in [this page](../materials/actions/set-default.md).
