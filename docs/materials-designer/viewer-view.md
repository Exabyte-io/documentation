# Interactive viewer: the "View" features

The first `View` button under the interactive functionality of the 3D graphical crystal viewer first gives you the possibility to rotate or zoom into the structure with your mouse (the rotation can also be made automatic). Next, you can also toggle the coordinate axes and reset the view to its original default one. 

Two editable numerical fields are also located at the end of this series of viewing options, the first one to modify the radius of the atom spheres, and the second to implement periodic boundary conditions on the original unit cell over a certain number of repetitions. 

The animation below summarizes all the above features:
