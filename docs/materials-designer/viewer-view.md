Each one of these actions will now be reviewed separately. Click on the animation included at the end of each section below to witness the corresponding action being implemented in the crystal viewer interface.    
 
# Rotate / Zoom View

Toggling this "Rotate / Zoom" option will allow the user to:

- Rotate the crystal view by moving the mouse around whilst holding the left button.
- Translate the crystal view by moving the mouse around whilst holding the right button.
- Zoom in or out of the crystal view by scrolling the central mouse wheel in either sense.

# Reset View

There might come a point, during the course of an interactive viewing session, in which the user might wish to revert to the original default view of the crystal under consideration, following any of the actions described so far in this page. This is precisely what the "Reset" option achieves.

# Repetitions

The user can edit this second numerical field to implement periodic boundary conditions on the original unit cell over a certain number of repetitions, defined by a positive integer number.
