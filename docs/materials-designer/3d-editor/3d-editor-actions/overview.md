# 3D Editor Actions

The present section of the documentation contains explanations on how actions of different types can be performed on the crystal structure being currently inspected in the [3D editor](../edit.md) of our interface. Such actions might for example involve modifying the atoms, or changing the overall size and shape of the enclosing unit cell of the crystal structure.

The user should click on the visuals included at the end of each section below to view the animations for the corresponding action.     

## [Add / Delete Atoms](add-remove-atoms.md)

[This page](add-remove-atoms.md) explains how to add or remove atoms from the crystal structure.

## [Adjust Unit Cell Parameters](adjust-cell-parameters.md)

The procedure for modifying the lattice vectors defining the edges of the unit cell is outlined [here](adjust-cell-parameters.md).

## [Clone Atoms](clone-atoms.md)

Atoms can be cloned [as follows](clone-atoms.md).

## [Group Atoms](group-atoms.md)

Atoms can also be grouped together as explained [in this page](group-atoms.md).

## [Rotate or Translate Atoms](move-rotate-atoms.md)

[This procedure](move-rotate-atoms.md) should be followed in order to rotate or translate atoms in different directions and/or configurations.
