# Clone Atoms

Cloning of atoms is performed by right-clicking on the atom's entry within the ["Scene" sidebar list](../edit.md#3.-scene) displayed towards the right-hand side of the [3D editor interface](../edit.md). After the right click, the user should then select the `Clone` option within the resulting menu.

## Animation

The cloning of atoms within a crystal structure is demonstrated in the same animation as the one included at the bottom of [this page](add-remove-atoms.md).
