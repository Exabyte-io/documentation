# Rectangular Selection

Through the "Rectangular Selection" option, the user can select a certain number of atoms within a rectangular selection window. First expand the window by holding your left mouse button, and then release it once all desired atoms have been covered by the selection. The selected atoms will correspondingly undergo a slight change of color.
