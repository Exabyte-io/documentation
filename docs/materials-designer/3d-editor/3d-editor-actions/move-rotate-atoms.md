## Toggle Rotate / Translate

Enabling "Rotate / Translate" feature displays a set of Cartesian coordinate axes alongside the structure viewed. Cartesian or spherical coordinate axes can be activated or hidden from the viewer interface at any time by pressing the `T` key. 

### Translation

Translational coordinate axes (cartesian) can be activated by pressing the `A` key.

#### Axial

The user can achieve an axial translation of the crystal with respect to this coordinate system by holding the corresponding axis with the left mouse button and then making the desired move. 

#### Planar

Planar translations can also be performed in much the same way, by holding the colored squares between the axes indicating the various planes of the Cartesian space.   

### Rotation

Spherical rotation axes are selected upon pressing the `R` key. This allows one to rotate the crystal basis along one of the three azimuth angles. Once the desired rotation is performed, these rotation axes can be collapsed back to the previous translation axes by pressing the "A" key again.
