# Rotate or Translate Atoms

## Toggle Rotate / Translate

Enabling the "Rotate / Translate" features, accessible via the corresponding buttons within the ["Footer" Menu](../edit.md#2.-footer-menu) of the main 3D editor interface, displays a set of coordinate axes alongside the structure being currently inspected. Depending on whether the `Translate` or `Rotate` option is selected, the resulting reference system will consist in Cartesian or Spherical coordinates respectively. In this way, the entirety of the crystal structure under investigation can be shifted in different ways, as described in what follows.

## Translation

After the translational coordinate axes (cartesian) are activated by pressing the `Translate` button, the following two possibilities are available to the user.

### Axial 

The user can achieve an axial translation of the crystal with respect to this coordinate system by holding the corresponding axis with the left mouse button, and then making the desired move. 

### Planar 

Planar translations can also be performed in much the same way, by holding the colored squares between the axes indicating the various planes of the Cartesian space.   

### Origin 

A further colored square is present at the origin of the cartesian coordinate system, which can be held and moved in very much the same fashion as in planar translations to achieve a translation of the origin point itself.

## Rotation

Spherical rotation axes are enabled upon pressing the `Rotate` option. This allows one to rotate the crystal basis along one of the three azimuth angles. 

## Animation

We demonstrate the execution of example translations and rotations of a crystal structure in the following animation.
