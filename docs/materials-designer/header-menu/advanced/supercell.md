# Supercells

A material has a crystal structure associated with it and the latter is described by a unit cell. There are an infinite number of unit cells U with different shapes and sizes which can describe the same crystal. The supercell of unit cell U is a cell which describes the same crystal, but has larger volume than cell U.

# Generating Supercells

Click on the `Supercell` option in the `Advanced` menu. The "Generate supercell" overlay highlighted in the image below will allow you to set parameters of the supercell matrix.

When finished setting up the transformation matrix, click on `Submit` and both the "Crystal Basis" and 3D representation of the structure will update accordingly.

# Animation

Click on the animation below to see the above in action. In this example, we generate a 2x2x2 supercell of a cubic structure by inserting the diagonal elements of the corresponding transformation matrix, whilst leaving the off-diagonal elements to zero.
