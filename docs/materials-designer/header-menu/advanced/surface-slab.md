# Surface / slab

Surfaces / slabs can easily be designed and generated with the Materials Designer upon entering information about the Miller indices of the corresponding crystal plane, the thickness of the slab in terms of layers, the vacuum ratio, and the supercell dimensions in both the planar x and y dimensions. Click on "Submit" once this information has been entered, and the corresponding surface / slab will appear in the graphical viewer.
