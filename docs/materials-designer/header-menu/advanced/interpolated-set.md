# Interpolated Set

Interpolated sets allows to represent atomic movements between an **initial** and **final** positions, and thus can represent chemical reactions. The initial and final positions must therefore contain the same atoms, with only positional changes.

Multiple intermediate (or "interpolated") structures, referred to as **images**, of the system being considered need to be generated by interpolation in between these initial and final configurations, by varying linearly the one-dimensional **reaction "coordinate"** (e.g. the atomic positions) from its initial to final value. 

This set of initial and final structures together with images [ordered](../../../entities-general/sets.md) in a particular manner constitutes the interpolated set for the chemical reaction.

## Example Usage


**Interpolated Sets** are used for the calculation of the energy profile and activation barrier for the chemical reactions via the [Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) method](../../../tutorials/dft/chemical/neb.md).

## Animation

In the animation below, we generate an interpolated set with 5 intermediate images from a pair of initial and final structures.
