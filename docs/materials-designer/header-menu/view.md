# View

The `View` menu allows user to modify the appearance of the Materials Designer interface. The location of this menu component within the interface is illustrated below:

![View](../../images/materials-designer/view-menu.png "View")


## Enable / Disable Component Panels

This `View` menu can be used to show or hide the panels of the Materials Designer interface, namely the items list `Sidebar`, the `3D Editor`, the `Source Editor` and the `Selection Info`. This is achieved by selecting or de-selecting each component in the menu. When a check-mark is present next to a component, it is selected and therefore visible in the interface, and vice-versa.

!!! warning "Coming soon"
    The support for the Enable/Disable action is yet to be added.

## Full-Screen Mode

The `Full-screen` <i class="zmdi zmdi-fullscreen zmdi-hc-border"></i> view of the interface can be accessed at the bottom of the `View` menu. This full-screen mode can be subsequently exited by pressing the Esc key (or another browser-specific alternative, as appropriate).
