# Available Advanced Features

Such advanced features are designed to help the user build complex crystalline structures, in particular:
 
* [Supercells](advanced/supercell.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i>
* [Surfaces / Slabs](advanced/surface-slab.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-layers zmdi-hc-border"></i>
* Polymers <i class="zmdi zmdi-polymer zmdi-hc-border"></i> 
* Nanotubes <i class="zmdi zmdi-camera-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i>
 
The possibility to generate different combinations of atoms or vacancies of different elements under a common underlying structural framework ([Combinatorial Sets](advanced/combinatorial-set.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i>) is also offered. 

Each one of these advanced constructor utilities is reviewed in detail in its own separate documentation page.
