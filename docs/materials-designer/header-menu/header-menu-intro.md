# Header Menu

At the top of the Materials Designer interface, users can find a header menu bar which provides the general functionality of the interface, such as importing the data and undo/redo. Four main submenus are present within this header menu bar, as listed below (please click on each header in this list to access the corresponding documentation page): 
  
# [Input / Output](input-output.md)

# [Edit](edit.md)

# [View](view.md)

# [Advanced](advanced.md)

# [Help](help.md)

At the right-end of this menu bar, a status indicator is also present: a check-mark <i class="zmdi zmdi-check zmdi-hc-border"></i> means that the computational engine of the interface is not currently busy, and that new tasks can therefore be launched.
