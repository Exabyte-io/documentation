# Import

Materials Designer can source structural data from the account-wise materials collection. We explain how to do that using the "Import" tool.

# Select "Import" Option

Select `Import` menu option <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

# Search Materials

Once the "Import materials" dialog page is open, select one or more desired entries, and then click the `Select Items` tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top right corner of the page to import the structures. 

# View Imported Items

The items selected in the previous step will be added to the list in the left-hand sidebar, together with the pre-existing ones. For more explanation on that see the [Sidebar Items](../../sidebar-items.md) page of this documentation. 

# Animation

The steps above are summarized in the animation below. We find a material containing "Aluminium" using the top search bar of the "Import materials" dialog and then import it. In the end we also remove the pre-existing default "Silicon FCC" material to leave only the new arrival in the items list sidebar.
