# Crystallographic Data Panel
 
In the middle of the Materials Designer interface, a central panel is present comprising all the necessary crystallographic data (in an editable form) for defining the crystal structure under consideration. 

Instructions on how to enter or modify information pertaining to the overall Bravais lattice of the structure, and those concerning specifically the atoms in the crystal basis, can be accessed in their respective pages below:
