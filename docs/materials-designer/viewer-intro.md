# 3D Interactive Crystal Viewer

A 3D crystal structure graphical viewer is located on the right-hand side of the Materials Designer interface. This viewer can be rendered interactive to modify the current 3D view of the crystal under consideration, or even edit some of its structural features, through simple mouse moves. The location of this viewer within the wider interface is highlighted below:

Interactivity is enabled by clicking on the `Interactive` switch button <i class="zmdi zmdi-power zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the top-left corner of the crystal viewer panel. Doing so will activate the following pieces of advanced interactive functionality, each documented in its own dedicated page:
 
# [Modify View of Crystal](viewer-view.md)  

# [Edit Crystal](viewer-edit.md)  

# [Export Crystal Information](viewer-export.md)  
   
Each button under the interactive viewer can be toggled by clicking on it, after which the button becomes yellow, and then de-activated again with a second click, following which the button goes back to being white. In addition, multiple buttons can be toggled simultaneously to benefit from all of their functions at the same time. 

Much of the functionality of this interactive viewer is already documented in Ref. [[1](#links)], although with some changes to the associated keys as indicated in the interactive buttons' notification tags (accessible by hovering the mouse cursor over each button).
