# Items List Sidebar

The complete list of crystal structures which can be handled in the Materials Designer is shown in the left-hand sidebar of the designer's graphical interface. The location of this sidebar within the wider interface is illustrated in the image below:

# Material entries

A checkbox appears on the left-hand side of a material's entry in the items list if the material's crystal structure is already present in the account-owned collection. 

Furthermore, all material entries with unsaved changes appear colored in yellow. Once the material has been saved according to the procedure outlined [here](header-menu/input-output/save.md), the corresponding entry will change from yellow back to white.

# Select Item

Each entry can be selected for further processing by simply clicking on it. Once a material has been selected, its corresponding crystal structure will automatically be displayed on the 3D interactive viewer on the right-hand side and all the associated crystallographic data will be inserted in the central panel of the interface.

# Delete Item

The option to delete <i class="zmdi zmdi-delete zmdi-hc-border"></i> a material from the items list is located next to each entry. 

# Edit Name of Item

The name of each entry can be edited accordingly by clicking on the corresponding text field. The material's chemical formula is also shown underneath its name for reference purposes.
