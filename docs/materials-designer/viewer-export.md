In particular, these actions consist in the following:

- Take a `Screenshot` of the crystal structure under its current view, and save it directly to the local hard drive as an image file.

- Visualize the crystal structure alone in a `Full-screen` mode of the interactive viewer, without the rest of the Materials Designer interface.
