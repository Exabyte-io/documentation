# Interactive viewer: the "Export" features

The final `Export` button under the interactive viewer (located at the bottom of the visualization window) makes it possible to take a screenshot of the crystal structure and save it locally to your hard drive as an image file, or alternatively to download the corresponding  crystallographic numerical information in the form of a POSCAR file. Finally, the opportunity to visualize the crystal structure alone in full-screen mode is also offered.
