# How secure is cloud computing?

*"Cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing, because companies like Google and Amazon can attract and retain cyber-security personnel of a higher quality than many governmental agencies." - Vivek Kundra, former federal CIO of the United States*

Cloud computing has over recent decades completely revolutionized the way we compute, store and interact with the data that is required for our daily work, in particular as a result of the amount of data getting constantly larger and needing to be accessible from many different devices scattered around the world simultaneously. New security issues of practical interest have however appeared as a result of this sweeping digital transformation [^fn1] [^fn2] [^fn3]. These are in particular related to the confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, and resilience to online piracy and malware attacks of the rapidly increasing quantity of data stored in the servers of the various Cloud service providers, that is often of sensitive nature to Businesses, Universities and governmental institutions. 

If you were genuinely worried about the security and privacy aspects of storing your data in a cloud environment, time has come to fear no more! The consensus is in fact growing among the global IT community that Cloud computing has now become inherently more reliable and secure than traditional privately-owned data-centers [^fn4] [^fn5], the same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people's money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer. The largest cloud service providers such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure and the Google cloud platform (the references of choice also for the Exabyte.io materials discovery engine) have in fact the means and resources to invest billions in improving and maintaining their own IT security protocols and general infrastructure, in a way which would be completely unaffordable and unmanageable for most small-to-medium sized enterprises and academic research labs. No wonder even the CIA now trusts the AWS cloud to store some of its classified information! [^fn6]  

We at Exabyte.io have gone at great lengths to ensure a smooth, confidential and highly secure materials modeling experience for our customers through our online Materials design and discovery cloud platform. We now implement some of the strictest security protocols available in the IT market today [^fn7] [^fn8], and the degree of data privacy and integrity protection we deliver has so far received universal acclaim and praise by all of our users. We are convinced, and we hope that you too are, that Exabyte.io should be fully engaged and at the forefront of the Cloud computing transformation age currently unfolding and casting its spell over so many leading Fortune-500 companies!
