We are often asked about the security of cloud-based solutions for storing mission-critical information, like the information about the materials and chemicals we deal with. This is a brief attempt to explain our position. 

# How secure is cloud computing?

> "Cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing, because companies like Google and Amazon can attract and retain cyber-security personnel of a higher quality than many governmental agencies."

## Concerns

Cloud computing has completely revolutionized the way we obtain, store and interact with the data in our daily work. In particular, now we take it as a must for data to be accessible from many different devices scattered around the world simultaneously. The rapidly increasing quantity of data stored in the multiple cloud service providers is often of sensitive nature to businesses, and governmental institutions. New security issues of practical importance have appeared as a result of this sweeping digital transformation. These are related to the confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, and resilience to online piracy and malware attacks, and are summarized in a publicly-available report by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) [1]. A comprehensive repository of general review papers on Cloud security issues and the recent progress in this field is offered by Exabyte.io in the online database linked to in Ref. [2]. Some examples of recent progress towards finding solutions to many of these security concerns are outlined in the excerpt of the paper by Dahiya and Rani linked to in Ref. [3].

## Examples

The consensus is growing among the global IT community that cloud computing has now become inherently more reliable and secure than traditional privately-owned data-centers [4] [5], the same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people's money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer. Such is the level of reliance and trustworthiness on Cloud services today that, without Cloud and mobility, companies like Facebook, Uber, Alibaba and Airbnb would be difficult to even imagine. The largest cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and the Google cloud platform (the references of choice also for the Exabyte.io materials discovery engine) have in fact the means and resources to invest billions in improving and maintaining their own IT security protocols, personell and general infrastructure, in a way which would be difficult for the Fortune 500 companies and completely unaffordable for most small-to-medium sized enterprises and/or academic research labs. 

For example, Microsoft has invested some US$1 billion in security and doubled its number of security executives over the course of the year 2015 alone [6]. The IT giant even announced the launch of a new managed security services group and a new cyber defense operations center. Similar policies are regularly being enacted by all other major Cloud provider companies, so much is protecting their customers from any kind of security threats and breaches of critical importance to the viability of their business model and reputation. Furthermore, a cloud provider will have secure servers hosted in a variety of locations regionally or globally, and this naturally safeguards data better than keeping it on-premise. No wonder even the CIA now trusts AWS to store some of its classified information! [7]  

## Our approach

We at Exabyte.io have gone at great lengths to ensure a smooth, confidential and highly secure materials modeling experience for our customers. We implement some of the strictest security protocols available today [8] [9], and the degree of data privacy and integrity protection we deliver has so far received universal acclaim by our users. We are convinced, that together we can extend the forefront of the cloud computing transformation currently unfolding ([10]) and apply it to accelerate the materials and chemical R&D.
