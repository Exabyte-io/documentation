## Data in transfer encryption

Encrypting data in flight or transfer involves encrypting the data stream at one point and decrypting it at another point. For example, if you download the result of a calculation from our data centers to your local computer and want to ensure confidentiality of this exchange, data in flight encryption is used to encrypt the data stream as it leaves our data centers, then to decrypt it at the other end of the channel on your local computer. Since the data exchange is very brief, the keys used to encrypt the frames or packets are no longer needed after the data is decrypted at the other end so they are discarded. Most common protocols used for in flight data encryption are IPsec, VPN and TLS/SSL. We use strong TLS/SSL encryption for exchanging data between all components of our application stack to make sure no one has access to your data while it leaves or enters our servers.
