WHAT SHOULD WE USE AS A TITTLE?

## Data center security

Exabyte.io data centers are state of the art, utilizing innovative architectural and engineering approaches. Data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass authentication to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.


### Fire Detection and Suppression

Automatic fire detection and suppression equipment has been installed to reduce risk. The fire detection system utilizes smoke detection sensors in all data center environments, mechanical and electrical infrastructure spaces, chiller rooms and generator equipment rooms. These areas are protected by either wet-pipe, double interlocked pre-action, or gaseous sprinkler systems.


### Power

The data centers electrical power systems are designed to be fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units provide back-up power in the event of an electrical failure for critical and essential loads in the facility. Data centers use generators to provide back-up power for the entire facility.

### Climate and Temperature

Climate control is required to maintain a constant operating temperature for servers and other hardware, which prevents overheating and reduces the possibility of service outages. Data centers are conditioned to maintain atmospheric conditions at optimal levels. Personnel and systems monitor and control temperature and humidity at appropriate levels.

## Data backups

We use high-available storage systems. Your data is replicated across multiple disks to ensure you would not loss the data on disk failures. In addition to disk replication, your data is backed up every day at 8 AM UTC on a separate high-available storage system. 

## Data ownership and visibility

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS?

## Penetration testing and Certifications

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS? DO WE HAVE ANY CERTIFICATE?
