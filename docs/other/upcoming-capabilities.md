Exabyte.io is focused on building a capable structure generator and manipulator to enable you to create a wide variety of structures interactivey and online.  Toward that vision we currently are working on the following capabilties review in brief below.  If you are particularly interested in one of the below capabilities or think a different capability is more important than those listed below, please don't hesitate to send us your suggestions at new@exabyte.io

# Surface generation

The real world is a complex interaction of materials with other gases, liquids, and solids.  When you take a crystal structure and terminate it in a particular direction at a defined thickness, you have created a surface.  At Exabyte.io we are focused on developing an surface generator capability that gives flexibility to choose any surface orientation, the atom terminating the surface for multi-element structures, and a passivation option as well.

# Passivation

Except in rare cases such the real world is not made up of perfect materials extended out to macroscopic dimensions.  This means that the perfect structures must terminate at some point or contain defects in their atomic structure.  If we leave these defects to simply be the absence of atoms, that is unphysical because it implies that eletrons in the structure are free to bond with anything and that is unstable.  At Exabyte.io we are focused on developing a capabilty to passivate with a wide variety of atoms in both a directed and automated manner to satisfy certain chemistry rules.

# Interface generation

The real world is a complex interaction of many different materials across atomic boundaries between these materials.  These interfaces are a difficult challenge for atomic simulations as a balance between the size of the atomic system and generality of the system must be maintained to enable reasonable computational times.  At Exabyte.io we are focused on developing an interface capability that uses the surface generation modulue outputs as input and allows one to search the linear algebra space of combining 2 different crystal cells together into 1 structure, enabling a study of the interfacial spacing and line-up of interfce atoms across that interface, and possible alterations of the interface structure to try to reduce the charge near the interface.

# Interstitials

Many crystal structure have natural voids in their structures called interstitices.  These intersticies are common locations of the diffusion and holding impurities in the structure.  Based on the symmetry, local bonding environment, and a free space finder it is possible to identify what locations are most likely to hold another atom of particular size or number of electrons

# Polymers

Creation of polymer structures is a rich and diverse area that requires a multitude of functionality.
