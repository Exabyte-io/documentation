## Community

We want materials scientists, chemists, physicists, computer scientists and others worldwide to join our mission of building a universal platform for software-driven materials design and discovery. Here is how you can participate:

### Case studies

For a limited time we are open to support users who are willing to use exabyte.io as a main tool for studying a particular problem and subsequently publish the results, and potentially, include them under [tutorials](getting-started/run-first-simulation.md) section of this documentation. For qualified candidates we will provide up to **100,000 CPU-hours** of computing free of charge.

    - Title of the proposed project for case study
    - Importance of the proposed project
    - Detailed explanation of the type of simulation techniques required and expected results

### Student program

For currently enrolled students that require access to our platform for educational purposes we are willing to provide up to **1000 CPU-hours** per month free of charge on a case-by-case basis.

**In order to apply**:

- send an email to support@exabyte.io with a subject containing "Student program"
- include the following information about yourself:
    - Full name
    - Name of educational instituion
    - Instructor and class identifier (eg. "UC Berkeley, Physics 290A")
    - Detailed explanation of the type of simulation techniques required and expected results

### Trello board

We set up an interactive board where you can vote of suggest upcoming features [here](https://trello.com/b/89eLrRW0/exabyte-io-feature-roadmap)). Your feedback is much appreciated and will be taken into account when deciding on what to implement next.
