# List of Available Models

We introduce in this section the [models](../models/overview.md) which are currently available on our platform, through their [methods](../methods/overview.md) computational implementations.

## [Density Functional Theory](dft/overview.md)

We implement **Density Functional Theory** as our primary model. The specific parameters which apply to this model are reviewed [in this page](../models-directory/dft/overview.md), whereas a review of its theoretical background is offered in the references listed [here](../models-directory/dft/references.md).
