# List of Available Models

We introduce in this section the [models](../models/overview.md) which are currently available on our platform, through their [methods](../methods/overview.md) computational implementations.

## [Density Functional Theory](dft/overview.md)

We implement **Density Functional Theory**, as introduced [in this page](dft/overview.md). A review of its theoretical background is offered in the references listed [here](dft/references.md).

## [Machine Learning](machine-learning/overview.md)

We support **Machine Learning** techniques in order to predict new material properties based upon previously calculated sets of properties. Our support for Machine Learning is introduced [in this section](machine-learning/overview.md) of the documentation.
