# Density Functional Theory Model

We introduce here the theoretical framework of **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**.

## [Parameters](parameters.md)

The list of parameters affecting DFT is presented [in this page](parameters.md).

## [Accuracy](accuracy.md)

We discuss the factors limiting the [accuracy](../../models/accuracy.md) of DFT [here](accuracy.md).

## [References](references.md)

A comprehensive list of references reviewing the theoretical background underlying DFT is outlined [in this page](references.md), to be referred to at the reader's discretion.

## [Structured Representation](data.md)

[This page](data.md) contains an example [structured representation](../../data-structured/overview.md) for the DFT model.

## [Special Notes](notes.md)

We have collected [in this page](notes.md) some special notes on special precautions that need to be taken when considering the different [parameters](parameters.md) of DFT.
