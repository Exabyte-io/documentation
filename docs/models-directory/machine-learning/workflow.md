# Machine Learning Workflow

Overall, a complete Machine Learning [workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) consists of the following multiple steps, operated in a sequential order through the implementation of the [units](../../workflows/components/units.md) specific to Machine Learning which are described [in this page](units.md).

1. Generating and gathering the training data set
2. Manipulating and Processing the data 
3. Transforming the data through scaling, etc.
4. Selecting the best features, through for example regression
5. Building the Machine Learning train model
6. Predicting new properties from the trained model

The user is referred to the [tutorial section](../../tutorials/ml/overview.md) on machine learning for more detailed information on the above steps.
