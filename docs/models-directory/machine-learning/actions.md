# Define Training Data Set

Assembling a **training data set** for [Machine Learning](overview.md) applications can be done through the [addition](../../jobs-designer/actions-header-menu/select-materials.md) of [materials](../../materials/overview.md) to the relevant training [Job](../../jobs/overview.md) and selection of targets and features, as thoroughly explained in [this tutorial page](../../tutorials/ml/train-ml-model.md).

<!--
## Upload Data Set

The user can also upload a new training data set to a machine learning [Workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) by clicking upon the `Choose File` button, located under the "Data Set" section of the [Overview Tab](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview-tab.md) within the [Subworkflow Editor Interface](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md).
