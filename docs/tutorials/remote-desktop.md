<!-- TODO by MH - ask TB if not clear -->

Our website provides you with a quick and easy way to submit your multi-step calculation methodolgies.  Our focus is to automate as much of this functionality as possible, but it is always possible that you may want more control over the execution flow of the methodologies or run a type of calculation completely different from anything we have yet implemented.  Our focus is to enable as much of this as possible through the web interface, but this may not be possible yet in all cases and some experienced users may be more comfortable submitting their simulations directly.  In addition in some cases for advanced visualization of properties it is easier to access a wider array of visualization tools using a remote desktop emulator running on a compute server for visulization functionality like XCrysden and Vesta

We provide a remote desktop function directly through the web to enable this.  We have pre-installed the following list of application for graphical visualization on the remote desktop:

1. XCrysden
2. Vesta

One must open a Remote Desktop Connection to the terminal so that you can run graphical interface programs for visualization.  Underneath the "Terminal" option in the right sidebar you used earlier in the tutorial is a "Remote Desktop" option.

Select this and a different overlay will appear in your web browser of a graphical user session.

Find and open XCrysden or Vesta under the "Other" dropdown menu item.
