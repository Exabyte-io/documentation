This tutorial describes the steps to run a desktop emulator through your web browser.  In some cases for advanced visualization of properties requires access a wider array of tools.  Therefore we provide a remote desktop emulator running on a compute server for visualization functionality.

# Pre-installed visualization software

We have pre-installed the following list of application for graphical visualization on the remote desktop:

1. XCrysden
2. Vesta

# Accessing remote desktop
One must open a Remote Desktop Connection to the terminal so that you can run graphical interface programs for visualization.  Underneath the "Terminal" option in the right sidebar you used earlier in the tutorial is a "Remote Desktop" option.

Select this and a different overlay will appear in your web browser of a graphical user session.

# Finding visualization apps

Find and open XCrysden or Vesta under the "Other" dropdown menu item.
