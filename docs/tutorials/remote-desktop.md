- Remote desktop visualization:     tutorials/remote-desktop.md
      - use previously created input file for espresso
      - visualize it using XCrysden/Vesta

Our website provides you with a quick and easy way to submit your multi-step calculation methodolgies.  Our focus is to automate as much of this functionality as possible, but it is always possible that you may want more control over the execution flow of the methodologies or run a type of calculation completely different from anything we have yet implemented.  Our focus is to enable as much of this as possible through the web interface, but this may not be possible yet in all cases and some experienced users may be more comfortable submitting their simulations directly.  In addition in some cases for advanced visualization of properties it is easier to access a wider array of visualization tools using a remote desktop emulator running on a compute server for visulization functionality like XCrysden and Vesta

We provide a remote desktop function directly through the web to enable this.  We have pre-installed the following list of application for graphical visualization on the remote desktop:

1. XCrysden
2. Vesta

To use the remote desktop, click on the right sidebar which is obtained by clicking on your username in the upper-right corner of the home page.  One of the options in this side bar is "Remote Desktop".  After clicking on "Remote Desktop" an overlay will appear filling up your browser window with a desktop  emulator called Guacamole.
