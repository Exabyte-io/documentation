# Vibrational Properties Tutorials

In the present section, we introduce the most common operations supported on our platform for performing **vibrational properties** computations on [materials](../../../materials/overview.md), implemented through the [Density Functional Theory model](../../../models-directory/dft/overview.md).

## [Zero Point Energy](zero-point-energy.md)

We review the procedure for computing the [Zero Point Energy](../../../properties-directory/scalar/zero-point-energy.md) of crystalline samples [in this tutorial](zero-point-energy.md).
