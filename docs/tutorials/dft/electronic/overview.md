# Electronic Properties Tutorials

In the present section, we introduce the most common operations supported on our platform for performing **electronic structure** computations on materials, implemented through the [Density Functional Theory model](../../../models-directory/dft/overview.md).

## [Band Structure](band-structure.md)

We review the procedure for computing the [electronic band structure](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/bandstructure.md) of crystalline samples [in this tutorial](band-structure.md).

## [Band Gap](band-gap.md)

The calculation of the [band gap](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/band-gaps.md) is the object of a [separate discussion](band-gap.md).

## [Density of States](density-of-states.md)

We also offer instructions on how to evaluate the [electronic Density of States](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/electronic-dos.md) under [this other tutorial page](density-of-states.md).

## [Charge Density Mesh](electronic-density-mesh.md)

Finally, we conclude our review of the electronic properties of materials by covering [a tutorial page](electronic-density-mesh.md) dedicated to the computation of the Electronic Charge Density Mesh.

## [HSE Calculations](hse.md)

[In this other tutorial](hse.md), we demonstrate how the use of the hybrid HSE functional can yield more accurate results for the example case of a band-gap computation.
