# Create Interpolated Sets

This tutorial page explains how to create an **interpolated set**, necessary for the calculation of the energy profile and activation barrier for the multi-dimensional energy space of chemical reactions via the Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) method, which is reviewed in a [separate tutorial](neb.md). We consider a three-atom molecule of Hydrogen throughout the present tutorial.

## The Need for Interpolated Sets

The NEB method is centred around the initial and final configurations (structures) for the chemical reaction under investigation. Multiple molecular structures, referred to as **images**, of the system being considered need to be generated in between these initial and final configurations, by varying a **one-dimensional reaction "coordinate"** from its initial to final value. This set of images taken together constitutes the interpolated set for the chemical reaction.

## Create an Ordered SET

## Upload Initial and Final Images to Materials Collection

## Create an Interpolated Set via Materials Designer

## Save all Images in SET
