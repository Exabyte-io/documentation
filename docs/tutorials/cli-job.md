<!-- TODO by MH - finish tutorial -->

Our product provides you with a quick and easy way to set up custom simulation methods. Our focus is to automate as much of this functionality as possible, but it is always possible that you may want more control over the execution flow or run a type of calculation different from anything we have yet implemented.  Our focus is to enable as much of this as possible through the web interface, but this may not be possible yet in all cases and some experienced users may be more comfortable submitting their simulations directly.

# Command-line Terminal

We provide a interface to a terminal command line window directly throught the web to enable this.  This is also the preferred method of execution for a software tool that we have not yet implemented in our automated framework.

To use the terminal interface, click on the right sidebar which is obtained by clicking on your username in the upper-right corner of the home page.

One of the options in this side bar is "Terminal".

After clicking on "Terminal" an overlay will appear filling up your browser window with a text based terminal emulator called Guacamole.
