# Tutorials on Jobs via Command Line Interface

We explain how the user can go through the procedure for [submitting jobs via the Command Line Interface (CLI)](../jobs-cli/overview.md) of our platform with the help of the following tutorials.

## Creating and Running Jobs

[This first tutorial](job-cli-example.md) explains how to create the input scripts for running a materials science computation with the [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software/modeling/quantum-espresso.md) modeling application. We also explain how to submit the corresponding [simulation job](../../jobs/overview.md) to the [Resource Manager](../../infrastructure/resource/overview.md) of our computational [infrastructure](../../infrastructure/overview.md) via the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md).

## Retrieving Results under Web Interface 

Once the execution of a job submitted via CLI is terminated, the corresponding output files containing the results of the simulation can be retrieved and inspected under the [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md). We explain how this can be achieved [in this second Tutorial](view-results.md).
