# UI overview

## Projects

We organize user workspace using projects. Project contains a study of a particular material or a set of materials that are related to each other. Projects have a single owner, and can have multiple users that collaborate together.

Here is how the list of projects looks like from within the application.

Every user has a default project with a name equal to username created for him/her at the moment of registration. You can create a new project by clicking (+) button at the top right corner of the page. You can delete the projects by using action buttons in the "Actions" row. Default project cannot be deleted by convention.

To see the jobs that belong to a project, click on the project's name.

## Jobs

When you click on one of the Projects you see the list of jobs.

## Materials
