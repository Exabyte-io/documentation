# Tutorials on Templating

In the present section we provide some examples of how [templates](../../workflows/templating/overview.md) for generating simulation input files, can be written and customized by using the [template engine](../../workflows/templating/engine.md) implemented on our platform.


## [Setting Input Parameter Based on Elemental Composition](set-magnetic-moment.md)

The process of setting input flags based on elemental composition is explained [here](set-flag-by-composition.md)

## [Setting Magnetic Moment on Atoms by Specie](set-magnetic-moment.md) 

Example of setting input flags (magnetic moment) based on atomic species is explained [in this page](set-magnetic-moment.md).
