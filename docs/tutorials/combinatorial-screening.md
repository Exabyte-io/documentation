- Combinatorial-screening:
       - enable combinatorial set
       - create a set with combinations for 3-5 semiconductors with unique names
       - create a set with permutations for a ~10 atom supercell with 2 dopants
       - submit both sets for execution
       - fast-forward
       - when finished navigate to analytics
       - find materials by Formula and compare bandgaps for both cases
