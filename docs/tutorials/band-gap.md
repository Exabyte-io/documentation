<!-- TODO by MH -->
The [kpoint convergence tutorial](kpt-convergence) shows a calculation of the band gap along with calculation of the total energy.  Please refer to that tutorial for the band gap in the results section.

!!! Note "DFT-LDA Band Gap error"
    Please note that this calculation will be performed using standard DFT-LDA and therefore underprediction of the band gap is to be expected.  Further modifications to the input files and settings to correctly predict the band gap are possible and will be explored in the future.
