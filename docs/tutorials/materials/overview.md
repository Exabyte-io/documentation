# Materials Operations Tutorials

In the present section, we introduce the most common operations supported on our platform for investigating and/or designing new [material structures](../../materials/overview.md).

## [Create Materials With VESTA under Remote Desktop](remote-desktop.md)

We explain [in this tutorial](remote-desktop.md) how a new crystal structure of bcc Iron can be designed with the help of the [VESTA](../../software-directory/analysis/vesta.md) graphical analysis and visualization software, implemented under our [Remote Desktop Interface](../../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md). We then illustrate also how the numerical information pertaining to such a crystal structure can later be transferred and retrieved in the main [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md) of our platform.

## [Generate Combinatorial Sets](combinatorial-screening.md)

In [this other tutorial](combinatorial-screening.md), we outline the implementation of [combinatorial sets](../../materials-designer/header-menu/advanced/combinatorial-set.md) for generating combinations and permutations of n and p-type dopant atoms in the Gallium Phosphide (GaP) semiconducting material structure.
