Exabyte.io is an integrated environment for materials modeling on the cloud. This documentation explains how it works. You may search for your topic of interest by using the input field in the top left corner or simply read on.

The [links](#links) section below can direct reader to sources of more in-depth explanation about what we are building and why [[1]](#links), quick demonstration of our product capabilities [[2]](#links) and example case studies [[3]](#links).

# Quickstart

You can skip straight to our tutorial summarizing [first steps with exabyte.io](getting-started/run-first-simulation.md). There will learn how to create and run a density functional theory calculation for the electronic bandstructure of silicon.

# Contents

The [content highlights](getting-started/content-highlights.md) page contains a quick overview of the features available and the corresponding links.
