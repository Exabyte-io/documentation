# Exabyte.io Documentation

Exabyte.io is an cloud-native accessible and collaborative environment for materials modeling from nanoscale. With the help of the platform, users can **design new materials** online and **predict the properties** of these materials using simulations. The present documentation explains how the platform works in details. 

## Search

You may search for your topic of interest by using the input field at the top.

The "Links" section below can direct readers to sources of more in-depth explanation about what we are building and why [^1] and example case studies [^2].

## Quickstart

You can skip straight to our tutorial summarizing [first steps](getting-started/run-first-simulation/web-interface.md). There you will learn how to create and run a density functional theory calculation for the electronic band structure of silicon.

## Contents

Navigation bar on the left also serves as the table of contents. You may click on any top-level item to expand the corresponding section. The [content highlights](getting-started/content-highlights.md) page has a quick overview of the features available and links into them.
