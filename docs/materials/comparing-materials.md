The analytics explorer webpage is a powerful tool to quickly sort, organize, and compare materials and their properties. As a users collection of materials grows the utility of the analytics and advanced search page grows. They are especially useful for combinatorial studies on a large number of materials. The analytics page is the best place to aggregate and visualize data from multiple materials and properties in once place.

# Search analytics

The analytics page can be reached on the left-hand side-bar. By default the page shows displays all materials in the user collection.  The search button (magnifying glass on upper right side of page) can be used to focus your comarison on a subset of the materials.  The animated gif below, show how using "Ga|In|As" we can focus in on all results for compounds with group III elements in them.

# Choose properties

In many cases a workflow or property calculation will quantify multiple properties within one simulation.  Using the analytics page we can focus our analysis in on a subset of properties by opening the `...` selector tool on the upper right hand side of the page.  In the animated gif below, it is shown how to focus the comparison of the materials set on indirect band gap and pressure only.

# Examine all results for a material

In many cases a property calculation will be run mutiple times on the same material with different results depending upon the simulation settings.  In this case the property of interest will have a note below the property such as "2 more".  This signifies that there are 2 additional instances of property calculation than the quantity displayed on the summary page.  By clicking on the material you will obtain a detailed summary page of all the instances of property calculation for that particular material. If there is a particular result of interest, you can also click on the 3 vertical dots to the extreme right of that data and select source to go to the job status page that generated that result.

# Graph properties

The analytics page can also be used to graphically summarize a range of material results.  Using the "Ga|In|As" referred to above, we can plot the "pressure" and "indirect band gap" of all the materials with one click. The resulting summary page will present all the materials names and values for each property.

# Advanced search

The advanced search icon in the upper right of the analytics page is an alternate way to quickly summarize all property calculation in the materials collection.  Upon clicking on the "advanced search" icon a new page will appear with 2 dropdown menus for "Property" and "Owner".  Selecting one or more of these menu items will reduce the number of materials visible below focusing on the materials that have calculations for the property selected and created by the owner choosen.
