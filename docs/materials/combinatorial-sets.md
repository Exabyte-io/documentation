Combinatorial sets are used to study a wide variety of modifications to a base crystal structure through atomic substituion of elements.  At Exabyte.io we want to enable automation of your combinatorial materials screening process to make it easier to set-up, monitor, and analyze the results.  To this end it is possible to specify what elements are substituted for each element in a structure and specify a different substituion rule for each position in the atomic structure as well.

Explain what combinatorial materials sets are, what they are used for and how they are created including the information from: https://exabyte.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PD/Combinatorial+materials+set

Put a link to how input is generated for combinatorial set.

NOTE: focus on structures-related information, instead of inputs and rupy-related functionality.
