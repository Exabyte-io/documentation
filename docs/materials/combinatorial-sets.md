<!-- TODO by MH -->

Explain what combinatorial materials sets are, what they are used for and how they are created including the information from: https://exabyte.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PD/Combinatorial+materials+set

Put a link to how input is generated for combinatorial set.

NOTE: focus on structures-related information, instead of inputs and rupy-related functionality.
