# Crystalline Materials

The complete **crystal structure** [^1] of a **crystalline material** is obtained when a [set of atoms](../properties-directory/structural/basis.md), known as the **basis atoms** or **repeating unit**, are convolved (combined) with each one of the lattice points of the underlying [Bravais lattice](../properties-directory/structural/lattice.md). 

This results in a structure with **long-range order**, contrary to the case of [Amorphous materials](amorphous.md). This order gives the crystal structure its corresponding [space group](../properties-directory/structural/space-group.md) symmetry assignment.
