# Crystalline Materials

The complete **crystal structure** [^1] of a **crystalline material** is obtained when a [set of atoms](../../properties-directory/structural/basis.md), known as the **basis atoms** or **repeating unit**, are convolved (combined) with each one of the lattice points of the underlying [Bravais lattice](../../properties-directory/structural/lattice.md). 

This results in a crystal structure with **long-range order**, which gives its corresponding [space group](../../properties-directory/structural/space-group.md) symmetry assignment.
