# Missing features from Viewer

Some interface sub-components and actions buttons might be missing from the Viewer interface, compared to its Designer counterpart. For example, the ["Edit" functionality of the 3D crystal viewer](/materials-designer/3d-editor/edit.md) present under Materials Designer will be missing from its corresponding Viewer interface, due to the inapplicability of all its crystal structure-changing actions under simple "viewing" circumstances.
