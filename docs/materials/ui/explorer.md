# Materials Explorer Interface 

There are features of the main Explorer user interface which are specific to the materials collection, relative to the [general aspects](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md). These concern the type of computed materials properties that can be displayed under the right-hand tabular section of the interface, highlighted in the image below:
