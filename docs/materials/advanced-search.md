# Advanced Materials Search

In order to perform a comprehensive search and filter the entries in the materials collection available for an account, the Advanced Search feature can be used.

# Activate Advanced Search

Click on the `Advanced Search` tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> offered in the top-right toolbar of the Materials page in order to activate the functionality and view the search query builder.

# Query Builder

Advanced search functionality is implemented through a flexible "Query Builder": an interface that allows users to construct arbitrary queries using logical rules and the supported fields. The search statements are structured in the form of "Groups", each containing a series of "Rules". Both Groups and Rules can be added to the overall logical flow with the help of the `+ Rule` and `+ Group` buttons, or deleted using the `-` button. The Rules inside each Group, and the Groups themselves, can be logically combined together through the "AND/OR" logical operators.

# Rules

Each Rule is composed of three successive entries. Firstly, a material structure property (such as its tags, formula, unit cell volume, band gap etc...) has to be selected from the initial drop-down menu. Secondly, a logical operator has to be chosen from the available list in the central drop-down menu. Finally, a  search string or numerical value corresponding to the sought material property can be entered in the third and final text field. 

# Execute Query

Once all the logical statements and operators have been inserted as part of the desired overall flow, the resulting advanced materials search can be executed by clicking the `Search` button, and the corresponding search results will then be displayed. Alternatively, the entire logical flow can be reverted to its original basic appearance with the neighbouring `Reset` button.

# Animation

All the aforementioned steps for performing advanced structure searches are further illustrated in the animation below. We will use the advanced search query builder to construct a query to filter the large dataset of materials (over 4000 entries) by the formula ("Al"), unit cell volume (less than "80" in cubic Angstroms) and tags containing a certain value ("high pressure").
