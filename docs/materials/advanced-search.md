# Advanced Materials Search

In case you would like to perform a complex and finely-tuned search in your personal collection of material structures, an `Advanced Search` feature <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> is offered in the top-right toolbar present in the Materials page. 

## Logical Flows

After clicking on this icon, you will be presented with a logical sequence of search statements.  These search statements are structured in the form of "Groups", each containing a series of "Rules". Both Groups and Rules can be added to the overall logical flow with the help of the `+ Rule` and `+ Group` buttons located on the right hand side of each Group entry, or deleted altogether with the adjacent `minus sign` option. The Rules inside each Group, and the Groups themselves, can be logically combined together through the Boolean "AND/OR" operator options placed at the top of each Group box. 

## Rules

Each Rule is composed of three successive entries. Firstly, a material structure property (such as its tags, formula, unit cell volume, band gap etc...) has to be selected from the initial drop-down menu. Secondly, a logical operator has to be chosen from the available list in the central drop-down menu. Finally, a  search string or numerical value corresponding to the sought material property can be entered in the third and final text field. 

## Final Search

Once all the logical statements and operators have been inserted as part of the desired overall flow, the resulting advanced materials search can be implemented with the blue `Search` button located at the bottom-right corner of the advanced search sequence, and the corresponding search results will then be displayed underneath it. Alternatively, the entire logical flow can be reverted to its original basic appearance with the neighbouring `Reset` button. 

## Animation

All the afore-mentioned steps for performing such advanced structure searches are further illustrated in the animation below.
