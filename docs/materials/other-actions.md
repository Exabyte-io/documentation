# Default Entities

Material and Workflow entities have "default" property associated with itself. The default material (and default workflow) are used to pre-configure the job and workflow designer. For example, the workflow templating context may adjust depending on the material, and users can fine-tune the adjustments by changing the default material. Alternatively, users can set the most use workflow as default in order to avoid changing it during the job submission. Default entry has a check-mark assigned to it under the "Default" column in the entity list.

## Material

In order to modify the default material, click the "Materials" option in the left-hand sidebar to open your collection of previously-designed or imported structures. Select structure by ticking its check-box at the beginning of the entry, and then click on the three vertical dots located at the end and select "Set default" in the actions menu.
    
## Workflow

The default workflow can be modified in a similar way as explained above.
