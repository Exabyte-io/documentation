If you have a structure that is not already present in the current Exabyte.io materials data bank we provide a couple of ways to import your structure.  Our search feature is automatically connected to Materials Project database of materials so any search you do of element combinations will show you results of structures also present in the Materials Project database meeting your criteria.  In addition, Exabyte.io currently reads a variety of input formats include VASP 4 and VASP 5 POSCAR, quantum-espresso, and CIF formats.  We will be adding additional input format methods based on the needs of our users and also plan to implement all possible input methods in pymatgen.
