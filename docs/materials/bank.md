# Copy Materials from shared Bank

We collect unique copies of all materials in a standard primitive representation [[1](#links)] in a central "Bank" collection. For accounts with private data, the corresponding entries are private and only visible to the members of the account. For the rest - the bank entries are visible to all platform users.

# Open Bank Page 

In order to import materials into a personal collection, first navigate to the bank page: select the "Bank" option in the left-hand sidebar and then "Materials".

# Search for material

Next, search through the list of materials with the help of the search bar <i class="zmdi zmdi-search"></i>. Read on about how to do [search](search-compare.md) and [advanced search](advanced-search.md). 

# Copy to account collection

To import material structures from the Bank to your own personal collection, simply select the desired entry by ticking the checkbox at the start of the entry line, and then click on "Copy" in the top-right taskbar of the page as demonstrated in the animation below.
