# Copy Materials from shared Bank

We collect unique copies of all materials in a standard primitive representation [[1](#links)] in a central "Bank" collection. For accounts with private data, the corresponding entries are private and only visible to the members of the account. For the rest - the bank entries are visible to all platform users.

# Open Bank Page 

In order to import materials into an account-owned collection, first navigate to the bank page: select the "Bank" option in the left-hand sidebar and then "Materials".

# Search for material

Next, search through the list of materials with the help of the search bar <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i>. Read on about how to do [search](search-compare.md) and [advanced search](advanced-search.md). 

# Copy to account collection

To import material structures from the Bank to your account-owned collection, select the desired entry by ticking the checkbox at the start of the entry line, and then click on `Copy` <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right taskbar of the page as demonstrated in the animation below.
