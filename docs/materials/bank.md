# Materials Bank

We collect unique copies of all materials in the "Materials Bank" collection. The general features of a Bank are discussed in the following [introductory page](/entities-general/bank.md). We assert the uniqueness by structural parameters and the use of standard primitive representation [[1](#links)].

# Mapping Function

Materials [Mapping Function](/entities-general/bank.md#bank-mapping-function) first calculates the standard primitive representation of the candidate structure. Next, the corresponding [hash string](/entities-general/bank.md#hash-strings) is produced. The hash is then compared against those of existing Bank entries in the [same manner](/entities-general/bank.md) as for other bank entries.

# Advanced Search

Advanced search functionality specific to Materials and available also for Materials Bank page are described [here](actions/advanced-search.md).

# Copy from Bank

The procedure of copying (or importing) Bank Materials into Account-owned Materials collection is described [here](actions/copy-bank.md).
