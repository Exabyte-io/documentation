# Copy Materials from shared Bank

We collect unique copies of all materials in a standard primitive representation [[1](#links)] in a central "Bank" collection. The general features of such Bank repositories are discussed in the following [general introductory page](/entities-general/bank.md). Advanced search functionality specific to the Materials Bank are further described [here](actions/advanced-search.md).
