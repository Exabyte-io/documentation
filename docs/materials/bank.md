# Copy Materials from the Shared Bank

To import new materials into your personal collection, select the "Bank" option in the left-hand sidebar and then "Materials". The user will be presented with a comprehensive list of centrally-stored and pre-defined crystal structures, which can be searched through with the help of the search bar at the top of the page. This materials bank database effectively complements the Materials Project collection of structures described in the `Import` section of this documentation. 

To import material structures from the Bank to your own personal collection, simply select the desired entry by ticking the checkbox at the start of the entry line, and then click on "Copy" in the top-right taskbar of the page as demonstrated in the animation below.
