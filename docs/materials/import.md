# Import structure

Currently we support direct import of structural data about materials from the Materials Project online database [[1](#links)]. The below explains how to do it step by step.


# Open import dialog

Open left-hand sidebar and navigate to "Materials" page. Then choose import tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-cloud-upload zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top right corner.

# Select Entries

Import dialog will let you select one or multiple entries from cloud database.

You will be presented with a full screen overlay window with a search box.  Enter the element, formula or material name to search for. To see more details about the structure and source of each entry in the list of structures, just click on it and expand it.

# Trigger Import

After selecting materials, click on the "import" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-cloud-upload zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the toolbar (top right). This will download the material and save it in your materials collection. To view the newly imported structure, go back to `Materials` collection page.

# Animation

All the aforementioned steps are demonstrated in the animation below.
