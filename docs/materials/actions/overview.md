# Materials-specific Actions

The following set of actions can be performed in the specific context of Materials from the corresponding [Explorer Interface](../ui/explorer.md), besides those of general applicability [introduced previously](/entities-general/actions/overview.md):

# Advanced Search

Materials stored in the Account-owned collection can be searched and retrieved using a more advanced search engine that the [basic version](/entities-general/actions/search.md), as explained in [this page](advanced-search.md).

# Import New Materials

Additional materials, beyond those available within the scope of our platform, can be accessed and imported from third-party online databases into the Account-owned collection by following [these instructions](import.md). 

# Upload New Materials

Alternatively, the user may wish to upload new materials into the Account-owned collection directly from local files containing the relevant crystal structure data, as outlined [here](upload.md).

# Set Default

Setting a material as the default choice among the list of collection entries might present some specific issues compared to the [general procedure](/entities-general/actions/set-default.md), and these are reviewed [in this page](set-default.md).

# Copy Materials from Bank

An animation for importing Materials from the Bank is shown [here](copy-bank.md), which follows from the [general introduction](/entities-general/actions/copy-bank.md).
