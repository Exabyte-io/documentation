# Select materials

You may select previously uploaded materials during job creation. Inside "Job Designer" use the actions dropdown <i class="zmdi zmdi-more-vert zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the header and select `Chose material`. A menu overlay where one can search for materials will appear. Search and select material entries to select them for the job.

You may select multiple materials at once. By default, one job will be created per each material. The name of the job will also contain the material formula as it is indicated in the job name (by the `{{FORMULA}}` template variable) when more than one material is present.
