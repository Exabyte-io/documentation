# Import Structure

Currently, we support direct import of materials structural data from the Materials Project online database [[1](#links)]. Below we explain how to do so step by step.

# Open Import Dialog

Under the [Account Profile](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page, first [navigate](/ui/specific/tabs-navigator.md) to the "Materials" tab. Then choose import tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-cloud-upload zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).

# Select Entries

Import dialog allows to select one or multiple entries from cloud database.

The user is initially presented with a full screen overlay window with a [search box](/entities-general/actions/search.md) at the top.  He/she can the enter the element, formula or material name to search for. Inspection of each listed structure is done by clicking and expanding it.

# Trigger Import

After selecting materials, click the "import" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-cloud-upload zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). This downloads the material and save it in the Account-owned collection. This newly imported structure can be viewed under the corresponding [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).
