# Advanced Materials Search

The steps for performing [advanced searches](/entities-general/actions/advanced-search.md) in the specific case of Materials are illustrated in the animation below. 

We will use the advanced search query builder to construct a query to filter the large dataset of materials (over 4000 entries) by the formula ("Al"), unit cell volume (less than "80" in cubic Angstroms) and tags containing a certain value ("high pressure").
