# Changing Default Material

The initial default material for a new Exabyte account is set to FCC Silicon [[1]](#links). As the user begins to grow the collection of materials, this default choice might subsequently need to be changed. We provide an explanation of this procedure [here](../../entities-general/actions/set-default.md).
