# Compute Tab

The final "Compute" Tab present under [Jobs Designer](overview.md) allows the necessary [computational resources](/infrastructure/resource/overview.md) to be allocated for the [Job](/jobs/overview.md) being currently created, in order to ensure its smooth execution on the [clusters](/infrastructure/clusters/overview.md) following its [Submission](/jobs/actions/run.md). 

The typical appearance of Compute Tab is exhibited below.
