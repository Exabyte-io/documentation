# Select and Add Materials to Jobs

The user may select one or multiple [materials](/materials/overview.md) present in the account-owned [collection](/accounts/collections.md) during [Job creation](../overview.md). Within the [header menu](../header-menu.md) of Jobs Designer, the relevant button <i class="zmdi zmdi-more-vert zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the right-hand side should be clicked, and the `Select materials` option chosen from the resulting drop-down menu.

# The "Select Materials" Dialog

As a result, the "Select Materials" dialog exhibited in the image below is opened.

![Select Materials](/images/select-materials-dialog.png "Select Materials")

Here, the user can [select](/entities-general/actions/select.md) one or multiple entries from the resulting list of materials, which is displayed in an [Explorer-type Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md). 

# Search for Materials

As conventional for [Materials Explorer](/materials/ui/explorer.md), a basic search bar <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> is offered on top of the dialog for [searching](/entities-general/actions/search.md) the relevant entries across the account-owned collection of materials. 

A more [advanced search](/entities-general/actions/advanced-search.md) functionality than the basic version can also be toggled through the corresponding button <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the [top-right actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).

# Add Materials to Job

Once the desired material(s) have been selected, they can be added to the Job being currently designed through the "Select Items" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-collection-plus zmdi-hc-border"></i> located under the [top-right actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). 

This returns the view to the main Jobs Designer, where the crystal structures of the imported materials can be freely inspected within the [Materials Tab](../materials-tab.md), under the conventional [Materials Viewer](/materials/ui/viewer.md) interface. It is worth noticing that the original default material which was present when the Jobs Designer was first opened is always replaced with the newly selected material(s). 

By default, one separate job will be created per each selected material. The name of the Job, as displayed under [Explorer](/jobs/ui/explorer.md), has the material formula appended to it when more than one material is selected during its designing phase.  

# Animation

In the example animation below, we demonstrate how to select and import a series of III-V Semiconductors to the Job being currently designed. We then cycle through them under the [Materials Viewer](../materials-tab.md) with the help of the pager, in order to review their respective crystal structures.
