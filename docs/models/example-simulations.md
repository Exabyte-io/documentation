<!-- TODO by MH -->
For all of the characteristic properties:
    for all supported simulation engines:
        list default input files used to to extract the property
        explain how we assert fidelity

Currently we support the characteristic property simulations [**here**](../materials/characterisitc-properties.md)

# Core Properties

## [Electronic wave functions](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Electronic-wave-functions)
Please see the [first simulation tutorial](../tutorials/first-simulation.md) for more details.

## [Electronic energies](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Electronic-energies)
Please see the [first simulation tutorial](../tutorials/first-simulation.md) for more details.

Both electronic energies and wave functions are calculated concurrently in the example below:

# [Principal Properties](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Principal-properties)
Please see the [first simulation tutorial](../tutorials/first-simulation.md) for more details.
Total Energy, Entropy, Fermi energy, Atomic forces, Stress tensor, Average pressure, and Charge density are all usually calculated concurrently as shown in the example below:
