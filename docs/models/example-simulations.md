<!-- TODO by MH -->
For all of the characteristic properties:
    for all supported simulation engines:
        list default input files used to to extract the property
        explain how we assert fidelity
        add link to the corresponding step-by-step tutorial under 'tutorials' folder

Currently we support the characteristic property simulations [**here**](../materials/characterisitc-properties.md)
# Core Properties

## [Electronic wave functions](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Electronic-wave-functions)

## [Electronic energies](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Electronic-energies)

Both electronic energies and wave functions are calculated concurrently in the example below:

# [Principal Properties](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Principal-properties)
Total Energy, Entropy, Fermi energy, Atomic forces, Stress tensor, Average pressure, and Charge density are all usually calculated concurrently as shown in the example below

# [Derived Properties](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Derived-Properties)
## [Electronic Properties](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Electronic-Properties)
### [Band Structure](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Band-structure)
### [Band Gap](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Band-gap)
### [Density of States and Partial DOS](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Density-of-States-and-Partial-DOS)
### [Fermi surface](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Fermi-surface)
## [Chemistry Properties](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Chemical-Properties)
### [Formation energy at 0K](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Formation-energy-at-0K)
## [Vibrational Properties](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Vibrational-Properties)

### [Zero Point Energy](../materials/characterisitc-properties#Zero-Point-Energy)
