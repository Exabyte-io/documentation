# Model Parameters

Our platform offers the following categories of model parameters, which can be edited by the user within the "Overview" tab of the [Subworkflow Editor Interface](../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview-tab.md).
 
## Type
  
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is as a widely used **Type** of model. Its theoretical background is reviewed further in the references contained in [this page](dft/references.md), whereas its specific parameters are narrated [here](dft/parameters.md). 

## Subtype

We refer to **Subtypes** as any generic sub-classification of the main model type.
 
## Refiners

**Refiners** can be further added to identify a more extensive simulation approach.

## Modifiers

**Modifiers** can be further added to identify a certain important modifications to the simulation approach (eg. the inclusion of magnetic interactions).
