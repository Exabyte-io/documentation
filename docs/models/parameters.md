# Model Parameters

Our platform supports the following model parameters, which can be edited by the user within the "Overview" tab of the [Subworkflow Editor Interface](../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview-tab.md).
 
## Type
  
Type of the model (eg. [Density Functional Theory](../models-directory/dft/overview.md)).

## Subtype

We refer to **Subtypes** as a generic sub-classification of the main model type.
 
## Refiners

**Refiners** can be further added to identify a more extensive simulation approach.

## Modifiers

**Modifiers** can be further added to identify a certain important modifications to the simulation approach (eg. the inclusion of magnetic interactions).

## Specific Implementation

Consult [Models Directory](../models-directory/overview.md) for specifics about the parameters of each supported model.
