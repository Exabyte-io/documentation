# Density Functional Theory
 
Our platform currently supports multiple widely used first-principles quantum computational engines (see [applications](../../software/overview.md)). These are based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) [^1] theoretical model, for calculating approximate solutions to Schrodinger's Equations and associated physical properties.
 
The reader who wishes to revise the fundamental theoretical framework underlying DFT is referred to the introductory literature on the subject [^2], as well as the references listed [in this page](references.md).

We present in what follows the [parameters](../parameters.md) which apply specifically to the DFT **model type**.

## Subtype

We support the following **Subtypes**.

- **Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)**, on which new subworkflows are based by default
- **Local Density Approximation (LDA)**, another commonly used model subtype

## Functional

We support the following list of exchange-correlation functional flavours.

- **Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)** [^3], the flavor implemented by default which is widely used.

> NOTE: for planewave pseudopotential DFT the functional part matches that used in the corresponding [pseudopotential](../../methods/pseudopotential/overview.md)

## Refiners

Hybrid Screened Exchange (HSE) [^4] or GW approximation [^5] (G0W0, for example) can be used as example refiners for a Density Functional Theory model.  

## Modifiers

DFT calculations might of might not treat the spin-orbit coupling interaction or magnetic interactions, which are both considered modifiers:

- Spin-Orbit Coupling (soc), a relativistic quantum physical interaction of a particle's spin with its motion inside a potential [^6]. 

- Magnetism (magn), resulting from the spontaneous polarization (parallel lining up) of the spins of conduction electrons in ferromagnetic metals, such as iron, nickel and cobalt, giving rise to a magnetic moment in these materials even in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field [^7].

## Accuracy 

For the case of the DFT Model, the input parameters that affect the [accuracy](../accuracy.md) include the ones listed below.

1. Electronic exchange and correlation functional used in the pseudopotentials 
2. Type of the model applied (eg. LDA, GGA, LDA + U, GGA + U, HSE, LDA + GW, GGA + GW)
