# The Reciprocal Lattice

In crystallography, the reciprocal lattice [[1](#links)] represents the Fourier transform of an original periodic Bravais lattice in the real physical space (the direct lattice). This reciprocal lattice exists in the so-called reciprocal space (also called "k-space"), which is in general the space in which the Fourier transform of a spatial function is represented.  

It follows from its definition that the reciprocal lattice of a reciprocal lattice is nothing but the original direct lattice again, since the two lattices are reciprocally related to each other by Fourier transforms. The reciprocal lattice plays a fundamental role in the analytic study of periodic structures, particularly in the theory of X-ray and neutron diffraction. 

Another important concept within the realm of reciprocal space is that of the Brillouin zone of a crystal, which consists in the Wigner-Seitz cell of the crystal's reciprocal lattice. 

# Mathematical definition

For an infinite three-dimensional Bravais lattice in real space, defined by its primitive lattice vectors $\left(\mathbf {a_{1}} ,\mathbf {a} _{2},\mathbf {a} _{3}\right)$, its reciprocal lattice can be determined by generating its three reciprocal primitive lattice vectors $\left(\mathbf {b_{1}} ,\mathbf {b} _{2},\mathbf {b} _{3}\right)$ through the following correspondence relations:

$$
{\displaystyle \mathbf {G} _{m}=m_{1}\mathbf {b} _{1}+m_{2}\mathbf {b} _{2}+m_{3}\mathbf {b} _{3}} 
$$

where

$$
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {b} _{1}&=2\pi {\frac {\mathbf {a} _{2}\times \mathbf {a} _{3}}{\mathbf {a} _{1}\cdot \left(\mathbf {a} _{2}\times \mathbf {a} _{3}\right)}}\\\mathbf {b} _{2}&=2\pi {\frac {\mathbf {a} _{3}\times \mathbf {a} _{1}}{\mathbf {a} _{2}\cdot \left(\mathbf {a} _{3}\times \mathbf {a} _{1}\right)}}\\\mathbf {b} _{3}&=2\pi {\frac {\mathbf {a} _{1}\times \mathbf {a} _{2}}{\mathbf {a} _{3}\cdot \left(\mathbf {a} _{1}\times \mathbf {a} _{2}\right)}}\end{aligned}}}
$$


# Some important relations

- Each point $(hkl)$ in the reciprocal lattice corresponds to a set of lattice planes $(hkl)$ in the real space direct lattice. 
- The direction of the reciprocal lattice vector corresponds to the normal to the real space planes. 
- The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector is equal to the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing of the real space planes.

# Some examples of reciprocal lattices

Some examples of reciprocal lattices for the cubic crystal system are offered below for illustrative purposes:

- The simple cubic Bravais lattice, with cubic primitive cell of side $a$, has for its reciprocal a simple cubic lattice with a cubic primitive cell of side $\textstyle {\frac {2\pi }{a}}$. 

- The reciprocal lattice to an fcc lattice is the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice.

- The reciprocal lattice to a bcc lattice is the fcc lattice.
