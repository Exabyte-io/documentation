# Modifiers

Several modifiers can be included as part of the subworkflow computation under consideration, through the corresponding drop-down menu in the "Model" section of the ["Overview" tab](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md) contained in the Subworflow Editor interface. These in particular allow for the inclusion of the following two atomic physical phenomena:

- Spin-Orbit Coupling (soc), a relativistic quantum physical interaction of a particle's spin with its motion inside a potential [[1](#Links)]. 

- Magnetism (magn), resulting from the spontaneous polarization (parallel lining up) of the spins of conduction electrons in ferromagnetic metals, such as iron, nickel and cobalt, giving rise to a magnetic moment in these materials even in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field [[2](#Links)].
