# Density Functional Theory Model

We introduce here the theoretical framework of **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**.

## [Parameters](parameters.md)

The list of parameters affecting DFT is presented [in this page](parameters.md).

## [Accuracy](accuracy.md)

We discuss the factors limiting the [accuracy](../accuracy.md) of DFT [here](accuracy.md).

## [References](references.md)

A comprehensive list of references reviewing the theoretical background underlying DFT is outlined [in this page](references.md), to be referred to at the reader's discretion.
