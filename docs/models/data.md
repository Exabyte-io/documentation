# Structured Representation of Models

The example of a JSON data structure, based upon the **[Exabyte Data Convention](../data-structured/overview.md)**, is shown below together with an associated example. 

The corresponding method components are also included in this example, and are explained further [in this section](../methods/overview.md) of the documentation. 

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/workflow/subworkflow/model.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!example/workflow/subworkflow/model.json!}
```
