# The Overview tab

The general appearance of the typical content of the "Overview" tab is presented in the image below, where four main sections are emphasized and will be described in turn throughout the rest of this documentation page.

## [The "Properties" section](../../properties/overview.md)

The first line in the "Overview" tab, labeled "Properties", contains a summary of the physical properties that will be computed during the course of the present calculation. These can be selected from a list of properties on the "Detailed View" tab, which is described [here](detailed-view.md). 

For a complete list of physical properties available for calculation, the reader is referred to [this page](../../properties/overview.md).

### [Low-fidelity Runs]()

Optionally, the check-box "Draft" on the left can be selected. In this case the resulting properties will not be available in the "Analytics" part of the output of the calculation. This option is convenient to choose when new prototypical workflows need to be tested in a preliminary fashion through low-fidelity runs.

## [The "Application" section](../../software/overview.md)

The subsequent "Application" section in the "Overview" tab allows you to choose which computational engine (otherwise known as application). More on this [here](../../software/overview.md) respectively.

## [The "Model" section](../../models/overview.md)

This section is documented extensively in its own dedicated [documentation chapter](../../models/overview.md). 

## [The "Method" section](../../methods/overview.md)

Similarly to the "Model" section, the "Method" section also has its own [documentation chapter](../../methods/overview.md).
