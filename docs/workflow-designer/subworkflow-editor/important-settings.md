# The Important Settings tab

When a new subworkflow is being created from scratch, the "Important Settings" tab is initially devoid of content. Once new computational Units are added to this new subworkflow (following the procedure outlined in [this page](units-flowchart.md)), the user will begin to see the settings global to all units contained in the subworkflow, as well as unit-specific settings, appearing in this tab.

The settings that can be set within this tab concern primarily the important [computational parameters](../../methods/parameters.md) related to the particular [method](../../methods-directory/overview.md) under consideration.

## Specific Implementation

Consult [Methods Directory](../../methods-directory/overview.md) for specifics about the important settings of each supported method.
