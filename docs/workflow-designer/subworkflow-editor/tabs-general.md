# Editor Tabs  

Each subworkflow is characterized by the input parameters contained in four distinct tabs within the Subworkflow Editor interface: the "Overview", "Important settings", "Detailed view" and "Compute" tabs. Each tab will now be reviewed in detail in the links presented below:

## [The "Overview" tab](overview.md)

Broadly speaking, the "Overview" tab includes all the general parameters characterizing the nature of the subworkflow materials calculation itself. For more information please click [here](overview.md).   

## [The "Important Settings" tab](important-settings.md)

This second tab comprises those technical parameters which define the accuracy of the calculation. This tab is described in detail [here](important-settings.md).

## [The "Detailed View" tab](detailed-view.md)

The "Detailed view" tab lists all the various different physical quantities that need to be calculated or monitored as part of the computation, as described [in this page](detailed-view.md). 

## [The "Compute" tab](compute.md) 

Finally, the "Compute" tab is to be consulted once all the previous input parameters have been set, in order to launch the workflow calculation on the Exabyte supercomputing cloud according to the user-defined order of subworkflows. The procedure for doing so is outlined [here](compute.md).
