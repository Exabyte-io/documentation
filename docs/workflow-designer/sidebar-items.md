# Items List Sidebar

Each workflow may contain many separate subworkflows. The complete workflow can be visualized in the sidebar on the left-hand side of the Workflow Designer interface. Here, the entirety of the current workflow under consideration is presented and summarized in the form of a flowchart, with the various "Subworkflow" modules executing different tasks listed sequentially in a vertical order (from the start of the workflow at the top, to its end at the bottom of the sidebar).

This flowchart of subworkflows initially defaults to a single entry named "Empty Subworkflow" when a new workflow is being created from scratch. Please see how subworkflow names can be changed, and how new subworkflows can be added to the overall sequence, in the Source Editor [documentation page](source-editor-intro.md).

An example of appearance of this sidebar list of subworkflow items, within the wider Workflow Designer interface, is highlighted in the image below:

# Selecting different subworkflows

The user can freely click and select any subworkflow module listed in this sidebar to analyze its task parameters, which are displayed on the Workflow Source Editor on the right of the Designer interface. Detailed descriptions of the significance of the various parameters contained in this Source Editor are offered in its corresponding [page](source-editor-intro.md).
