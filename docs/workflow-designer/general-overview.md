# What is Workflow Designer?

 The Exabyte platform provides a convenient interface for conceiving, executing and saving workflows which implement numerous types of calculations in the computational atomistic study of materials, such as the computation of thermodynamic quantities,  phonon dispersion curves, and electronic band structures. We refer to this interface as the Workflow Designer, and we will now reviewed it in detail. 

# Components of the Interface

The Workflow Designer is structured into three main building blocks, and has the typical initial default appearance as shown in the picture below when a new workflow is being created from scratch via the "Create Workflow" action introduced [in this page](../workflows/actions/create.md). In this image, the three main components of the interface are delimited in red. To access their respective documentation pages, please click on each component's red panel directly on the image:
