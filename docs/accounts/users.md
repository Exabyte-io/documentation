# Users

The notion of a **User** employed throughout the present documentation manual, refers to a human person performing any of the possible actions on the Exabyte platform. This notion should not however be confused  with that of [**Accounts**](overview.md#accounts), which may comprise multiple users. 

A User has to [switch to](ui/switcher.md) one of (potentially) multiple distinct accounts which are available to him/her in order to perform any actions.
