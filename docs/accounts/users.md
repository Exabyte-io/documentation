# Users

The notion of a **User**, when cited throughout the present documentation manual, refers to any physical person who is performing any of the possible actions on the Exabyte platform. This notion should not however be confused  with that of **Accounts**, despite the two terms often being used interchangeably in many other websites. In our platform, in fact, a User can log into multiple distinct accounts which are available to him, some of which he owns and some other collaborative ones to which he might have been added by other users.
