# Service Levels

Service levels define most importantly the cost of computational consumption that the user has to incur while using our product. We quantity the amount of computational consumption in compute-units, otherwise known as [core-hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_time). By definition, the Service Level is associated uniquely to the account that the user is currently logged into.

Other features associated with using our platform which are affected by the opted Service Level consist in the following list:

| Feature  | Description  	|
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Minimum Payment |  Minimum one-time initial payment necessary for account to be activated. This payment will still contribute to the account's balance for performing computational tasks |
| Validity Period |  The duration of time over which the account will remain active and accessible by the users |
| Reserved Compute Nodes |	The number of supercomputing clusters which are made available to the users of the account | 
| Month Data Usage | The total quota of storage space which is allocated to the account on a monthly basis |
| Private Data  | The possibility to hold private entities inside an account. Otherwise all entities are public for all other platform users to see |
| Organizations/Teams  | The possibility to create organization accounts, and multiple teams inside each of these organizations |
| Maximum Team Size  | The maximum number of users that can be hosted inside teams in general |
| Support Level	| The different forms and depths of support that users will receive by our support staff in case of technical difficulties being encountered |
| Command Line Access  |  The possibility to access the platform interface via command line |
