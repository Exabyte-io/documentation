# Account Preferences

!!!warning "Warning: content with restricted access"
    All the information contained under the present documentation page is only relevant for Account Owners or Administrators, since only they have sufficient rights to view the content exposed herein and make the appropriate changes. We remind the reader that a user is always the Owner and full administrator of his own personal Account.

Under the `Preferences` tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the general "Account Profile" interface, the user can set various preferences and settings for the present account that he owns or administers. Alternatively, the same Account Preferences can be accessed from the [right-hand sidebar](/ui/universal/right-sidebar.md) of the general User Interface, under the option labelled "Account Preferences" <i class="zmdi zmdi-settings zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

In particular, these preferences are comprised of the following elements:

# General Profile Information

This first aspect of the Account Preferences allows the user to insert account-wise general profile information, such as the name, profile picture, website and e-mail address associated with the account. A complete guide on which specific information can be entered in this section can be found [here](preferences/profile.md).

# User Settings

Under this section, the user is allowed to enter a suffix which will be appended to each job that is cloned via the jobs explorer page, as explained in detail [here](preferences/settings.md). 

# API Tokens

In addition, under the Account Preferences new API tokens can also be generated, and how to do so is explained [here](preferences/ssh.md).

# SSH Keys

Here, the user can add, remove and create SSH keys that will be associated with his account. Full instructions on how to do so can be found [in this page](preferences/ssh.md).

# Update password

It may come a point at which the account Owner or Administrator might feel necessary that the account-wide password be changed for security or convenience purposes. The procedure for performing such a change is outlined [here](preferences/password.md).
