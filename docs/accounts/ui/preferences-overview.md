# Account Preferences

Under the `Preferences` tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the general "Account Profile" interface, the user can set preferences and settings for the present account that he/she owns or administers. Alternatively, the same Account Preferences can be accessed from the [right-hand sidebar](../../ui/right-sidebar.md) of the general User Interface, under the option labelled "Account Preferences" <i class="zmdi zmdi-settings zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

## [General Information](preferences/profile.md)

This first aspect of the Account Preferences allows the user to insert account-wise general profile information, such as the name, profile picture, website and e-mail address associated with the account. A guide on which specific information can be entered in this section can be found [here](preferences/profile.md).

## [User Settings](preferences/settings.md)

Under this section, the user is allowed to enter a suffix which will be appended to each job that is cloned via the jobs explorer page, as explained in detail [here](preferences/settings.md). 

## [API Tokens](preferences/api.md)

In addition, under the Account Preferences new API tokens can also be generated, and how to do so is explained [here](preferences/api.md).

## [SSH Keys](preferences/ssh.md)

Add, or remove SSH keys to be associated with the account here. Full instructions on how to do so can be found [in this page](preferences/ssh.md).

## [Update password](preferences/password.md)

It may come a point at which the account Owner or Administrator might feel necessary that the account-wide password be changed for security or convenience purposes. The procedure for performing such a change is outlined [here](preferences/password.md).
