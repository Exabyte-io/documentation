# Charges, Payments, and Payment Methods

By clicking on the `Billing and Payments` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-card zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the [right-hand sidebar](/ui/universal/right-sidebar.md) of the platform interface, the user will be able to review the lists of the charges incurred by his account from performing computations on our platform, and the payment transactions executed to address those charges. The possibility to view the Payment Methods information being currently used for covering the necessary account-wide payments, and to add additional Payment Methods, is also offered under the same page. 

The typical appearance of this "Billing" page is exhibited below, wherein highlighted in red are the three tabs necessary for viewing charges, payments, and payments methods:

# Review Charges and Payments

Under the first two tabs of the above-mentioned "Billing" page, labelled "Payments" <i class="zmdi zmdi-file-text zmdi-hc-border"></i> and "Charges" <i class="zmdi zmdi-file zmdi-hc-border"></i> respectively, the user is able to review the charges for the account under consideration. These two tabs concern respectively the money paid so far by crediting the [Account Balance](../balance.md), and the charges incurred as part of the computational tasks executed under the present account. 

These two balance sheets are both presented to the user as items lists under the standard [Explorer-type](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) interface of our platform. The total sum of all the entries under each list is also indicated at the top of the page.

[Search bars](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> are present at the top of both balance sheet pages. An [Advanced Search](/materials/actions/advanced-search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> feature is further offered in the tool bar of the Charges page, in order to filter charges even more effectively.

<!-- 

    TODO: GM to revise the page:
    - create central place for advanced search in entities
    - add animation of advanced search to this section (maybe under actions)

# Payment Methods

For the moment, our platform only supports payments via Credit Cards as the only accepted payment method. By navigating to the page under the "Payment Methods" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-card zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the "Billing" page, the user will be able to inspect the relevant information regarding all the previously-added Credit Cards which are already active under his account and are therefore available to credit the account balance. 

He will furthermore be given the possibility to add new payment methods, in the form of new Credit Cards information, to make them available as options for future payments. This can be done following [these instructions](../accounting/payment-methods.md).
