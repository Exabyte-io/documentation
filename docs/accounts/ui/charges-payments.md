# Charges, Payments, and Payment Methods

Click `Billing and Payments` <i class="zmdi zmdi-card zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [right-hand sidebar](//ui/right-sidebar.md) to review the list of charges incurred by the account, and the payments executed to address them. The possibility to view or add Payment Methods is also offered. 

An example of a "Billing" page is exhibited below. We have highlighted in red the tabs for viewing charges, payments, and payments methods.

# Charges

Under the tab labelled "Charges" <i class="zmdi zmdi-file zmdi-hc-border"></i> the user can review the charges applied to the [Account Balance](../balance.md) while using our platform.

# Payments

Under the "Payments" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-file-text zmdi-hc-border"></i>, the user can review the money paid so far by crediting the [Account Balance](../balance.md). 

# Actions

Both Charges and Payments sheets are presented under the standard [Explorer-type](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) interface. The total sum of all the entries under each list is also indicated at the top of the page.

## Search

### Quick Search

A [Search](/entities-general/actions/search.md) bar <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> is present at the top of both balance sheets. 

### Advanced Search

An [Advanced Search](/entities-general/actions/advanced-search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> feature is further offered in the Charges page, in order to filter them more effectively. We offer an example of this action [here](../accounting/charges-advanced-search.md).
