We remind the reader that a user is always the Owner and full administrator of his own personal Account.


By clicking on the `Billing and Payments` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-card zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the [right-hand sidebar](/ui/universal/right-sidebar.md) of the platform interface, the user will be able to review the complete balance sheets concerning both the charges incurred by his account from performing computations on our platform, and the payment transactions executed to address those charges. The possibility to view the Credit Card information being currently used for covering the necessary account-wide payments, and to add additional Credit Cards, is also offered under the same page. 

The typical appearance of this "Billing" page is as exhibited below, wherein highlighted in red are the three tabs necessary for reviewing charges, payments, and for adding new payments methods:

    The first time that an account is used under our platform following its creation, the contents of all the pages mentioned here will be empty.

# Review Charges and Payments

Under the first two tabs of the above-mentioned "Billing" page, labelled "Payments" <i class="zmdi zmdi-file-text zmdi-hc-border"></i> and "Charges" <i class="zmdi zmdi-file zmdi-hc-border"></i> respectively, the user is able to review the complete financial balance sheet for the account under consideration. These two tabs concern respectively the money paid so far by crediting the [Account Balance](../balance.md), and the charges incurred as part of the computational tasks executed under the present account. 

These two balance sheets are both presented to the user as items lists under the standard [Explorer-type](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) interface of our platform. The total sum of all the entries under each list is also indicated at the top of the page.

[Search bars](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> are present at the top of both balance sheet pages. An [Advanced Search](/materials/actions/advanced-search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> feature is further offered in the tool bar of the Charges page, in order to filter charges even more effectively.

# Payment Methods

For the moment, our platform only supports payments via Credit Cards as the only accepted payment method. By navigating to the page under the "Payment Methods" tab <i class="zmdi zmdi-card zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the "Billing" page, the user will be able to inspect the relevant information regarding all the previously-added Credit Cards which are already active under his account and are therefore available to credit the account balance. 

He will furthermore be given the possibility to add new payment methods, in the form of new Credit Cards information, to make them available as options for future payments. This can be done following [these instructions](../accounting/payment-methods.md).
