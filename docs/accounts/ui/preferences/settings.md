# User Settings

## Clone Suffix
![Clone Suffix](../../../images/accounts/clone-suffix.png "Clone Suffix")

Here, the user is given the opportunity to enter a suffix which will be appended to each job that is cloned via the [jobs explorer page](../../../jobs/ui/explorer.md). This suffix initially defaults to "(clone)", but it can be modified appropriately by the user to any custom entry.

## Material Cell Type

Here, user can specify primitive or Conventional unit cell representation to be used by default while visualizing materials in [3D Editor](../../../materials-designer/3d-editor/view.md).

## Save Changes

Once the user has chosen and entered the new desired Clone Suffix and Material Cell Type, the `Save` button should be pressed to register the change to the account.
