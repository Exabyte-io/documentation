![Clone Suffix](../../../images/accounts/clone-suffix.png "Clone Suffix")

Here, the user is given the opportunity to enter a suffix which will be appended to each job that is cloned via the [jobs explorer page](../../../jobs/ui/explorer.md). This suffix initially defaults to "(clone)", but it can be modified appropriately by the user to any custom entry.

## Save Changes

Once the user has chosen and entered the new desired Clone suffix, the `Save` button should be pressed to register the change to the account.
