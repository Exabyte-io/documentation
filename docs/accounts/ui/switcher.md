# Account Switcher

The possibility to switch between all Accounts available for login to the user is offered as the top option under the [right hand menu sidebar](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md) of the wider platform interface, under the label `My Accounts` <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i>. 

# Currently Logged-in Account

The name and type of the account that the user is currently logged into is displayed at the top-right corner of the interface, under the button that needs to be pressed to access the entire right-hand sidebar. 

# View and Choose Accounts

If the user created, or is a member of, an [organization](/collaboration/organizations/overview.md), clicking on the `My Accounts` option will open the complete list of organizations <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i> to which the user belongs, besides his own personal account <i class="zmdi zmdi-face zmdi-hc-border"></i>. This list is presented under a standard [Explorer-type interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md), with its associated actions and features. The user is then free to switch between his personal account and any of these other organizational accounts by clicking on their corresponding names among the list of account entries. 

Once the user has decided to start using our product as a member of an organization, the interface will consequently reflect the change by showing the data related specifically to the organizational profile, for example storage quota and balance affecting the wider organization as opposed to the user's personal consumption.

# Example

For example, in the image below, two accounts are listed under the main Account Switcher page, and can be chosen from: a personal account labelled "Team Exabyte", and a wider organizational account called "Exabyte.io". It can furthermore be noticed, looking at the icon at the top-right corner of the screen, that the account in which the user is currently logged is the personal "Team Exabyte" one:
