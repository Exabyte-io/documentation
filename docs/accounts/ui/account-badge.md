# Account Badge

The "Account Badge" is always present at the top-right corner of any page under the main [header bar](/ui/header-footer.md) of the user interface, and displays useful general information for reference purposes about the Account that the user is currently logged into.
 
 The information displayed in the Badge in particular comprises the Account **name** and **[type](../overview.md)**, between **"Personal"** and **"Enterprise"**. The latter type in this context is a synonym for Organization, and should not be confused with the "Enterprise" Service Level. The profile picture of the Account is also displayed here.
  
 The Account name and profile picture can be modified at any time by the user under the [Profile information section](preferences/profile.md) of the [Account Preferences](preferences-overview.md).

An example of Account Badge for an Account of personal type is displayed in its right-hand location within the main [header bar](/ui/header-footer.md) in the image below. In this example, the personal Account belongs to a platform user called "John Doe":
