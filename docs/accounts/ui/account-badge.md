# Account Badge

The "Account Badge" is always present at the top-right corner of any page under the [header bar](../../ui/header-footer.md) and displays the general information about the Account that the user is currently logged into.
 
## General Information
 
 The general information comprises the Account **name** and **[type](../overview.md)**, between **"Personal"** and **"Enterprise"**. "Enterprise" in this context is a synonym for Organization, and should not be confused with the "Enterprise" [service Level](../service-levels.md). The profile picture of the Account is also displayed here.
 
 The name and profile picture can be modified at any time by the user under the [Profile information section](preferences/profile.md) of the [Account Preferences](preferences-overview.md).
 
## Example for Personal Account
 
An example of Badge for an Account of personal type is displayed in its right-hand location within the [header bar](../../ui/header-footer.md) in the image below. In this example, the personal Account belongs to a user called "John Doe".

## Example for Organization Account

In this other example, the Badge for an Organization (Enterprise) Account under the name of "Exabyte.io" is highlighted in the same context.
