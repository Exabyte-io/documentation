# Service Levels

!!!warning "Warning: content with restricted access"
    All the information contained under the present documentation page is only relevant for Account Owners or Administrators, since only they have sufficient rights to view the content exposed herein and make the appropriate changes. We remind the reader that a user is always the Owner and full administrator of his own personal Account.

The concept of Service Levels, introduced previously [in this page](../service-levels.md), can be reviewed for the present Account under the `Service Level` tab button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-layers zmdi-hc-border"></i> of the general "Account Profile" User Interface. 

# Balance and Storage Quota Indicators

Once this option has been clicked upon, the user will be presented on top of the resulting page with general information about both the available (under "Current") and Reserved [Account Balances](../balance.md) on the left, and general information about the consumed (again under "Current") and the total limit for the [Storage Quota](../quota.md) on the right. 

> Note: under the present version of our platform, this latter storage quota information refers exclusively to the status of the supercomputing node currently set as the default one, and NOT to the combined storage quota from all available nodes.

Moreover, the possibility to increase both of these Balance and Storage Quota indicators with extra credit is offered under the corresponding option buttons below each of the two indicators. The overall appearance of the interface for inspecting these two indicators and adding credit to them is demonstrated in the example below:

# View Current and Available Service Levels

Details about the Account's current and available Service Levels are shown on the same page, directly below the above-mentioned indicators. Here, the user will be confronted first with a clear indication of the cost per CPU hour associated with each service level, and then directly below with a complete list of services and features included under each level and at what amount (if applicable). 

Finally, at the bottom of each service level plan, the distinction between whether that particular service level is already the current selection for the present account, or whether it is available as an "Upgrade" from the current level, is drawn.  The service level that has currently been opted-for is greyed-out and has the label "Current" inscribed at its bottom. The other available service levels are placed next to each other, so that the user can immediately appreciate their differences and make a wise choice on which level might suit his Account best.  

# Pricing and Service Features

For more information about the services offered under each different level and the associated prices, please consult the [Service Levels Pricing page](/pricing/service-levels.md). Further explanation about what the various services imply in terms of functionality can be retrieved [here](../service-levels.md). Higher pricing requisites naturally trigger greater levels of service and associated benefits.

# Example Appearance

An example of the way that service levels, together with the various features and cost per CPU hour that they offer, are presented at the bottom of the "Service Levels" interface page is demonstrated in the example image below. It can be deduced that the Service Level on the right labelled as "Pro" is the current choice for the present account, whereas the one on the left named "Advanced" is available as an "Upgrade".

# Change Service Level

The action of Upgrading the current choice for Service Level can be performed from the `Upgrade` button present under the desired Service Level plan (if available). Downgrading is not available as an option, since a pre-payment has to be executed for the entire duration of the validity period of the chosen Service Level, with no possibility to revert the choice during this period. For this reason, if the most powerful Service Level out of all the available options has already been chosen as the Current plan, all other plans will automatically appear as greyed-out, which indicates that they are disabled for selection.

In the same way as adding credit to the [Account Balance](../accounting/increase-balance.md), the user can select the option `Auto-renew` in order to safeguard this level of service before the validity period expires. The user should finally click on `Confirm` to make the payment and activate the new desired service level.
