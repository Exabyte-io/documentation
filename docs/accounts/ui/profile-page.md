# The Account Profile Page

The "Account Profile" page represents the core command centre of any Account present on our platform, encompassing all User Interface components which are essential for users to operate and manage the Account itself, and the various entities that it contains.

The Account Profile page can be subdivided into several interface components, some of which are related to the general management of the account in a similar spirit to those accessible [elsewhere](overview.md), and some others which are instead related to [Entities](/entities-general/overview.md).
 
 These interface components are highlighted in the image below. The position of the **"Account Summary"**, displaying information about the Account's name, username and date of creation, is also exhibited. The reader is referred to the list ensuing the image for references to the documentation pages explaining each component in turn:

> Note: for the case of organization accounts, some of these interface components are visible only to the Account Owners and Administrators, and not to regular members.

# Components Related to Account Management

The above image shows the location of the access points to each of the following interface components related to general Account management, under the corresponding numbered labels:

## 1. Account Biographical Information

The user can view general profile information about the current account under the corresponding Biographical ("Bio") [component of the interface](bio.md). 

## 2. Service Levels

Various Service Levels, offering different price-to-quality ratios with regards to the basic and optional features of our platform, are available for selection by the Account Owner or Administrators.

## 3. Account Preferences

General Accounts preferences and Settings, such as the account's biographical information and password, can be set or edited by the Account Owner or Administrators under the corresponding [interface component](preferences-overview.md).


# Components Related to Entities 

The  "Account Profile" page furthermore allows the various Account-owned Entity Collections to be accessed from their associated ["Entity Tabs"](/ui/specific/tabs-navigator.md), located at the top of the page. Each tab leads to the ["Explorer Interface"](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) for the corresponding [entity type](/entities-general/overview.md).
