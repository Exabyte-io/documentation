# Accounts Explorer

The complete list of existing accounts opened in the Exabyte platform to date is accessible from the final section of the [left-hand sidebar menu](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md), under the option `Accounts` <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i>. Once this option is clicked upon, the user will be presented with the complete list of accounts, viewable and navigable under a standard [Explorer-type interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) with its associated actions and features.

By clicking on any item in this list of Accounts, the user will be able to inspect the Account's profile information under the [Bio](bio.md) tab, as well as all entities created under that Account which have been made [Public](/collaboration/sharing.md) for all users to see.
