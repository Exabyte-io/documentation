# Accounts Explorer

The list of existing accounts opened in our platform to date is accessible from the [Left-hand Sidebar](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md), under the option `Accounts` <i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i>. The list of accounts is implemented through an [Explorer-type interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) with its associated layout and actions.

# Viewing Account Information

Clicking on an item in the Accounts Explorer, allows user to inspect the corresponding Account's information, including its [Bio](bio.md), as well as the entities created under that Account which have been accessible to the user account or made [Public](collaboration/sharing/access-levels.md).

# Example

The image below shows an example of a list of accounts being viewed under the Accounts Explorer interface:
