# Account-related User Interface Components

Different User Interface components are available, under the wider general [interface of our platform](/ui/universal/ui-overview.md), to edit or insert information pertaining to Accounts, such as the Account-related profile information and settings. Further utilities are provided, for example, to switch between the various accounts available for login to the user, or for navigating the platform-wide general list of existing Accounts.

Each of these interface components will now be reviewed separately, based on which general location they can be accessed from:
