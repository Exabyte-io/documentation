# Accounts-related UI

Multiple User Interface components are available, under the wider general [interface of our platform](../../ui/overview.md), to edit or insert information pertaining to Accounts. Further means are provided, for example, to switch between the accounts the user is a member of, or for navigating the platform-wide list of existing Accounts.

Each of these interface components is reviewed below, based on the location they can be accessed from.

## [Account Profile](profile-page.md)

The interface elements accessible from the "Profile" page are reviewed [separately](profile-page.md). Its general appearance is shown below.
