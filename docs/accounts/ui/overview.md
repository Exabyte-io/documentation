# Accounts-related UI

Multiple User Interface components are available, under the wider general [interface of our platform](/ui/universal/ui-overview.md), to edit or insert information pertaining to Accounts. Further means are provided, for example, to switch between the accounts the user is a member of, or for navigating the platform-wide list of existing Accounts.

Each of these interface components is reviewed below, based on the location they can be accessed from.

# Components in Account Profile Page

The account-related interface components accessible from the general **"Account Profile"** page are reviewed in a [separate documentation page](profile-page.md). This Account Profile page has the general appearance as shown in the following example:

## 2. Account Switcher Trigger

The user can switch between the various different accounts that he/she owns, or that may have been made available to him by other users, by logging into any of the accounts listed under the "Account Switcher" [component of the interface](switcher.md).

Account Owners or Administrators can review the complete list of payments and charges incurred by their account, and change or insert new payment methods, under the corresponding ["Billing and Payments" page](charges-payments.md).
