Your account is split into three tabs as below.

# Bio (Profile)

This page shows information about you, to which teams and organizations you belong and what you have recently worked on. This can be set as private/public depending on your service level. Higher service level are able to make all information private. We also let users add a description and role to your account to share with other Exabyte.io users.
