# Accounts-related UI

Multiple User Interface components are available, under the wider general [interface of our platform](/ui/universal/ui-overview.md), to edit or insert information pertaining to Accounts. Further means are provided, for example, to switch between the accounts the user is a member of, or for navigating the platform-wide list of existing Accounts.

Each of these interface components is reviewed below, based on the location they can be accessed from.

The interface elements accessible from the "Profile" page are reviewed [separately](profile-page.md). It has the general appearance as shown below.
