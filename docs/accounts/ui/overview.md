# Account-related User Interface components

Different User Interface components are available, under the wider "Account Profile" page of the platform, to edit or insert information pertaining to Accounts, such as the Account-related profile information and settings. Further utilities are provided for example to switch between the various accounts available for login to the user, or for navigating the platform-wide general list of existing Accounts.

Each of these interface components will now be reviewed separately. The user should refer to the numbers labels on each highlighted portion of the image below to access the documentation pages of the corresponding interface component considered here, which are referenced in the subsequent list of header sections. This image shows the location, within the general interface of the platform, of the buttons that need to be pressed to access and edit the information associated with each component, with the exception of the two sidebars which have been moved out of the original appearance of the interface for visibility purposes:

> Note: for the case of organization accounts, some of these interface components are visible only to the Account Owners and Administrators, and not to regular members.
