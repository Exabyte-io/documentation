# Advanced Search of Charges

Account Charges can be searched in an [advanced fashion](/entities-general/actions/advanced-search.md), as introduced [in this page](../ui/charges-payments.md#advanced-search).

# Animation

In the animation below, we begin by opening the Advanced Search bar under the Charges page, accessible via the corresponding button <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). We then search for charges incurred during the course of year 2018, and executed on the cluster-007 (under the alias "cluster-007") and review the total sum of charges. After taking a quick look at the search results, we conclude by resetting the view of the items list to its original appearance.
