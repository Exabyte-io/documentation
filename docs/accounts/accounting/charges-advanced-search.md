# Advanced Search for Charges

Account Charges can be searched in an [advanced manner](/entities-general/actions/advanced-search.md), as introduced [in this page](../ui/charges-payments.md#advanced-search).

# Animation

In the animation below, we begin by opening the Advanced Search via the corresponding button <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). We then search for charges incurred during the course of 2018, and executed on machine name that contains "cluster-007". We review the total sum of charges, and the search results, and reset the items list to its original appearance.
