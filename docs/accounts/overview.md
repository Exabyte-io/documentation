# Accounts

The concept of "Account" within the context of our platform broadly refers to the multiple different ways in which a user can engage in **actions** on the [entities](../entities-general/overview.md), such as [creating](../entities-general/actions/create.md) [Materials](../materials/overview.md) or [running](../jobs/actions/run.md) [Jobs](../jobs/overview.md) or collaborating with other users by [sharing](../collaboration/sharing/actions.md) entities with them. 

> For the explanation of how the term "User" is compared with the more general concept of "Account", please refer to the [following page](users.md).

## [Account Entities](collections.md)

Accounts perform actions on the Entities stored in the corresponding collections as explained in the [corresponding page](collections.md).

## [Types of Accounts](ui/switcher.md)

It is important for the present discussion to draw a distinction between two different types of accounts: **Personal** accounts for individual users, and collaborative accounts with a membership comprising multiple users, referred to as **Organizational** or **Enterprise** (the two words are used interchangeably). The User can choose which account to use among all the available options through the Account Switcher, described [here](ui/switcher.md).

### Personal Accounts

To every user of our platform is associated a Personal Account, created at the moment of registration. The User is by definition always the sole member of their personal account, and consequently also the owner and administrator thereof.

### [Organizations](../collaboration/organizations/overview.md)

The concept of Organization, or collaborative account, is the object of a separate explanation in [its dedicated page](../collaboration/organizations/overview.md).

## [Service Levels](service-levels.md)

The quality of service for the account, including features such as private data, pricing and quotas are defined by the account's [service level](service-levels.md).

## [Balance](balance.md)

Account [Balance](balance.md) allows to perform actions that require monetary exchange.

## [User Interface](ui/overview.md)

Accounts can be manipulated, navigated, and defined according to certain settings or descriptions through the corresponding interface, introduced [here](ui/overview.md).

## [Accounting Actions](accounting/overview.md)

Each User can perform a certain set of Actions in relation to the Account that he/she is currently logged into, and these are narrated starting from [this page](accounting/overview.md).
