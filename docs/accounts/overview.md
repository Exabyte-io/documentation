# Accounts

The concept of "Account" within the context of our platform broadly refers to the various different ways in which a user can engage in actions such as creating [Materials](/materials/overview.md) or runing [Jobs](/jobs/overview.md) or collaborating with other users by sharing entities with them. 

> For the explanation of how the term "User" is compared with the more general concept of "Account", please refer to the [following page](users.md).

# Types of Accounts

It is important for the present discussion to draw a distinction between two different types of accounts: **Personal** accounts for individual users, and collaborative accounts with a membership comprising multiple users, referred to as Organizational or **Enterprise**. The User can choose which account to use among all the available options through the Account Switcher, described [here](ui/switcher.md).

## Personal Accounts

To every user of our platform is associated a Personal Account, created at the moment of registration. The User is by definition always the sole member of their personal account, and consequently also the owner and administrator thereof.

## Organizations

The concept of Organization, or collaborative account, is the object of a separate explanation in [its dedicated page](/collaboration/organizations/overview.md).

# User Interface

Accounts can be manipulated, navigated, and defined according to certain settings or descriptions through the corresponding interface, introduced [here](ui/overview.md).

# Accounting Actions

Each User can perform a certain set of Actions in relation to the Account that he/she is currently logged into, and these are narrated starting from [this page](accounting/overview.md).
