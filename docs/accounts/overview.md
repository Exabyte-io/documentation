# Accounts

The concept of "Account" within the context of our platform broadly refers to the various different ways in which a user can perform a login, and subsequently engage in actions such as for example starting to run Jobs and collaborating with other users by sharing entities with them. 

> For an explanation of how the term "User" is defined here vis-a-vis the more general concept of "Account", please refer to the [following page](users.md).

# Types of Accounts

It is important for the present discussion to draw a distinction between two different types of accounts: **personal accounts** on one hand, and on the other **collaborative accounts** with a membership comprising multiple users, which shall henceforth be referred to as **Organizations**. The User can choose which account to log into among all the available options through the Account Switcher, described [here](ui/switcher.md).


## Personal Account

To every user of our platform is associated a Personal Account, created at the moment of registration. The User is by definition always the sole member of his own personal account, and he is consequently also the owner and administrator thereof.

## Organizations

The concept of Organization, or collaborative account, will be the object of a separate thorough explanation in [its dedicated page](/collaboration/organizations/overview.md).

# User Interface

Accounts can be manipulated, navigated, and defined according to certain settings or descriptions through the corresponding graphical User Interface, introduced [in the following page](ui/overview.md).

# Accounting Actions

Each User can perform a certain set of Actions in relation to the Account that he is currently logged into, and these are narrated starting from [this page](accounting/overview.md).
