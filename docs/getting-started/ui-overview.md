## Compute Load
The compute load shows in a simple indicator of how busy the compute nodes are. There are three levels: low, medium and high. It is opportune to start jobs when the indicator is low in order to achieve a quicker turnaround. Conversely, if the compute load is high, wait times for job turnaround will be longer.
