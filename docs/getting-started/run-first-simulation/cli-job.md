# Jobs via Command-line Interface

The user may want more control over the [workflow execution](../../workflows/overview.md), or run a type of calculation we have yet to implement. For that purpose, we provide access to our platform through [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../../cli/overview.md), were [simulation Jobs](../../jobs/overview.md) can be executed.

Complete instructions on how to operate job submission via CLI can be found [in this section](../../jobs-cli/overview.md). We also provide a [tutorial](../../tutorials/jobs-cli/job-cli-example.md) dedicated to this topic, including on how to [retrieve and inspect](../../tutorials/jobs-cli/view-results.md) the final results of the simulation.

## Command-line Interface

We provide an an incorporated [Web Terminal](../../remote-connection/web-terminal.md) to conveniently access the CLI. Alternatively, the user can use the [SSH protocol](../../remote-connection/ssh.md).

To use the former Web Terminal interface, open the [right-hand sidebar](../../ui/right-sidebar.md) and click `Terminal`.

The simulations that have been submitted through the main [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md) are under the `data/<username>` sub-directory under the main [Login Home directory](../../infrastructure/login/directories.md).

Our [queuing system](../../infrastructure/resource/queues.md) is controlled through the use of [batch scripts](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/overview.md). The reader can find batch script templates under the [job templates directory](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/directories.md#job-templates).

## Create job

### Prepare subdirectory

To create a job under the CLI, we recommend working inside the aforementioned `~/data/<username>` sub-directory. The user should create a new [working directory](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/directories.md#working-directory) under this sub-directory (called `test_job`, for example).

```bash
mkdir test_job
```

A convenient way to get acquainted with our CLI is to start by copying the template [batch script file](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/overview.md) from within the `~/job-script-templates` [folder](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/directories.md#job-templates), and rename it as `job.script`. These actions can be performed with the following command, for the example case of the [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso/overview.md) template.

```bash
cp ~/job_script_templates/espresso/job.pbs ~/data/<username>/test_job/job.script
```
 
Copy any necessary simulation input files or executables into this current working directory as well.

### Edit submission script

The user may need to edit the batch script if he/she wants to use a [simulation software](../../software-directory/overview.md) other the default. Directions on how to set resource manager variables can be found in [the batch script examples](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/sample-scripts.md). A comprehensive list of the resource manager options is available [here](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/directives.md).

In addition, if the user would like to alter runtime environment for the calculation, can may consult [modules environment](../../cli/environment.md) section of our documentation.

Lastly, the options for choosing the queue to submit the job can be found [here](../../infrastructure/resource/queues.md).

!!!tip "Accounting Project Parameter"
    In order to specify a [project](../jobs/projects.md) that the job should belong to and should be [charged upon](../accounts/payments-charges.md), the instructions contained [in this page](../../jobs-cli/accounting.md) should be followed. 

In the present tutorial we will proceed with the default submission script template, without modification.

## Submit job

As a next step, the user can [submit the batch script](../../jobs-cli/actions/submit.md) for job execution using the `qsub` resource manager command: 
 
```bash
 qsub job.script
```
 
Our resource management system will respond with a message letting know that the job was accepted.

## Monitor job

In order to check on the [current status](../../jobs-cli/actions/check-status.md) of the job, type the following command. 

```bash
qstat
```

Once the job starts running, all the output will be placed in the [working directory](../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/directories.md#working-directory) where the `qsub` command was originally executed from (unless the "directory" line was changed within the batch script file).
