# Component Types

We subdivide the generic user interface into universal components that are present in each and every page, and other components that appear in specific cases.

# Universal Components

Five components are highlighted in the image below. Clicking each area of this image redirects the user to the corresponding documentation page.

!!!note "Note: color conventions of highlighted sections in images"
    In images presented throughout this documentation manual, we use the coloring convention of encircling relevant interface components in red, and triggers to other components in orange.

# Specific Components

Other general user interface components are instead accessible only from specific locations. The panels highlighted below are worth a separate discussion.

## 1. Homepage Navigation Trigger

The homepage of the Account is universally accessible through our company logo present at all times in the top [header bar](header-footer.md).
 
[This page](specific/homepage.md) explains how the homepage can be navigated by the user to make the initial general choices on the nature of the computations that he/she wishes to perform on our platform.

## 2. Dashboard Trigger

A general system status "Dashboard" can be accessed via the [left-hand sidebar menu](left-sidebar.md). It is explained in detail in [this page](specific/dashboard.md).

## 3. Tabs Navigation

Numerous pages on our platform, and most notably the [Account Profile](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page, contain a series of Tabs towards the top for ease of page navigation. Such Tabs are reviewed [here](specific/tabs-navigator.md).
