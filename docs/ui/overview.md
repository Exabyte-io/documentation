# Component types

We subdivide the generic user interface into universal components that are present in each and every page, and other components that appear in specific cases.

# Universal Components

Five distinct components are highlighted in the image below. Clicking on each area of this image will redirect the user to the component's corresponding documentation page.

!!!note "Note: color conventions of highlighted sections in images"
    In all images presented throughout this documentation manual, we will use the coloring convention of encircling relevant interface components in red, and triggers to other components in orange.

# Specific Components

Other general user interface components are instead accessible and viewable only from specific locations. The panels highlighted in the image below are worth noticing, corresponding to the interface components listed subsequently under the same number labels:

## 1. Homepage Navigation Trigger

The homepage of the Account is universally accessible through our company logo present at all times in the top [header bar](header-footer.md) of the user interface.
 
[This page](specific/homepage.md) explains how this homepage can be navigated by the user to make the initial general choices on the nature of the computations that he/she wishes to perform on our platform.

## 2. Dashboard Trigger

A general system status "Dashboard" can be accessed via the [left-hand sidebar menu](left-sidebar.md) of the wider user interface. It is explained in detail in [this page](specific/dashboard.md).

## 3. Tabs Navigation

Numerous pages on our platform, and most notably the [Account Profile](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page, contain a series of Tabs towards the top of the page for ease of page navigation by the user. Such Tabs are worth a separate [general presentation](specific/tabs-navigator.md).
