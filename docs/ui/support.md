# Support Widget

Clicking the `Support` widget at the bottom-left corner of the User Interface opens the following dialog.

# Required Information 

Here, the user can submit support requests for overcoming technical issues. They will be dealt with by the Exabyte Support Staff in the shortest delay possible, via e-mail communication. For this reason, the user is kindly asked to provide his/her email address in the central text field of the widget, besides the question being posed. 

Optionally, the user's name can also be entered. Finally, the Support Widget offers the possibility to include up to five file attachments, in order to clarify the nature of the problem. The Exabyte administration recommends attaching screen cast recordings for demonstrating the problem.  

# Send Support Request 

The email message can finally be sent to the Exabyte support staff by pressing the `Send` button at the bottom of the widget. 

Alternatively, the message contents can be erased by selecting the `Cancel` option, or equivalently by clicking the minimization icon at the top-right corner of the widget.
