# Tabs Navigation

Tabs are a widespread user interface feature on our platform, and offer a convenient way of navigating the contents of a certain page without having to leave the page itself. Tabs are resourceful when used in the contexts of the [Account Profile page](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) or the [Jobs Designer page](/jobs-designer/overview.md) for example.

# Switching between Tabs

Switching between tabs and their associated contents is achieved by simply clicking on the desired tab header towards the top of the page. If we take the Jobs Designer page as an example, then its three main tabs can be clicked upon and browsed as shown in the following animation:
