# Tabs Navigation

Tabs are a widespread user interface feature on our platform, and offer a convenient way of navigating the contents of a certain page. Tabs are resourceful for example when used in the context of the [Account Profile page](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) or the [Jobs Designer](/jobs-designer/overview.md).

# Switching Between Tabs

Switching between tabs and their associated contents is achieved by clicking the relevant tab towards the top of the page. If we take the Jobs Designer as an example, then its three main tabs can be browsed as shown in the following animation.
