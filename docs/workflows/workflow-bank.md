# The Workflows Bank

The most common types of calculations routinely encountered in atomistic computational materials science have already been assembled by the Exabyte research staff in the form of pre-defined workflows, and are currently available for distribution in a central repository accessible to all Exabyte users which is referred to as the Workflows Bank (to be compared with the equivalent Bank facility for pre-defined material structures documented [here](../materials/bank.md)). Through such pre-built workflows, the user is therefore spared from having to re-implement common ab-initio material computations such as the calculation of the total energy of crystals, of phonon dispersion curves and density of states, and of electronic band structures. 


# Importing workflows from the Bank into collection

To import new pre-assembled workflows from this central Bank repository into the account-owned workflows collection, select the `Bank` option under the main left-hand sidebar of the Exabyte platform, and then click on "Workflows". The user will be presented with a comprehensive list of centrally-stored and pre-defined workflows, which can be conveniently searched through with the help of the search text bar located at the top of the Bank page. 

To import the desired workflow(s) from this Bank database into the account-owned workflows collection, simply select the desired items by ticking their checkboxes at the start of the corresponding entry lines, and then click on "Copy" <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right toolbar of the Bank page.

# Animation

In the animation below, we demonstrate how to import a pre-defined workflow, which performs general electronic band structure calculations on crystals, directly from the Workflows Bank into the account-owned workflows collection. The workflow is retrieved from the Bank upon entering and searching for the "band structure" keywords on the top search bar of the Bank page:
