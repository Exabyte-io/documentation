# The Workflows Bank

The most common types of calculations routinely encountered have already been assembled by in the form of pre-defined workflows, and are currently available for distribution in a central repository accessible to all users. We  refer to it as the Workflows Bank (to be compared with the equivalent Bank facility for pre-defined material structures documented [here](../materials/bank.md)). 

User-created workflows are also saved into the Bank collection for convenience. For accounts with elevated service levels the corresponding entries are private and only visible to the account members, public workflows are visible to all users. 
 
 Through such pre-built workflows, the user is therefore spared from having to re-implement computations such as the calculation of the total energy of crystals, of phonon dispersion curves, electronic band structures and similar.


# Importing workflows from the Bank into collection

To import a workflow from this Bank repository into the account-owned collection, select the `Bank` option under the main left-hand sidebar of the Exabyte platform, and then click "Workflows". The user will be presented with a comprehensive list of centrally-stored and pre-defined workflows, which can be conveniently searched through with the help of the search text bar located at the top of the Bank page. 

To import the workflow(s) from this Bank database into the account-owned workflows collection, select the desired items by ticking their checkboxes at the start of the corresponding entry lines, and then click on "Copy" <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right toolbar of the Bank page.

# Animation

In the animation below, we demonstrate how to import a pre-defined workflow, which performs the electronic band structure calculation, from Workflows Bank into the account-owned collection. The workflow is retrieved from the Bank upon entering and searching for the "band structure" keywords in the search bar of the Bank page:
