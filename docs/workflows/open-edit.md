# Opening and editing existing workflows

The user might wish at some point to modify or simply consult an existing workflow, which had been previously [created](creating-workflows.md) (or [imported](workflow-bank.md) from the Workflows Bank) and then [saved](../workflow-designer/header-menu-actions.md) to the account-owned workflows collection.

# Opening a workflow in Workflow Designer

The user can choose any workflow listed in the workflow collection page, and can then open it directly in the Workflow Designer interface to review and eventually bring changes to its computational parameters and overall structure. 

To open a workflow, two equivalent approaches can be adopted: either the user can directly click on the name of the workflow towards the left-hand side of the corresponding entry line within the workflow collection, or he can proceed via the `Open` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the actions drop-down menu button labelled with a three vertical dots located at the right-end of the entry line that needs to be opened.

In either way, the final outcome will be the opening of the Workflow Designer interface displaying all the computational parameters and flowchart structure of the workflow under consideration, for further inspection and modification. The way workflow parameters can be inserted and/or edited in this Designer interface is extensively explained in its dedicated [chapter of the documentation](../materials-designer/general-overview.md).

# Animation

We demonstrate both ways of opening a workflow which already exists in the account-owned collection, and how to consequently view it on the Workflow Designer interface, in the animation below:
