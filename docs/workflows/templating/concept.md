# Templating Important Concepts

**Templating** is a general concept in computer science [^1] for automating and generalizing the mass-production of scripts based on a common fundamental framework, referred to as the core **"Template"** for those scripts. Different sets of **input parameters (or variables)** can then be passed to this template in order to generate distinct scripts, each representing a custom variant of the original template.

## Origins in Web Development 

Templating is commonly encountered in web publishing, where it lets web designers and developers work with web templates to automatically generate custom web pages. In this case, web templates support static content, providing the basic structure and appearance of the web page, on top of which more complex dynamic elements can then be added.

The basic process for a web templating system is illustrated in the picture below. Here, the content parameters of the web-page (originating from a database), and a web template, are combined together through the **Template Engine** to mass-produce web documents.
