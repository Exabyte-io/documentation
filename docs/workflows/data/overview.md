# Structured Representations of Workflow Components

We introduce in this section the JSON representations for [Workflows](../overview.md), and for each of their sub-components. We base such representations on the data convention, which is the object of a [separate discussion](../../data-structured/overview.md).

## [Workflows](workflows.md)

The structured representation of [workflows](../overview.md) is described [here](workflows.md), by way of example.

## [Subworkflow](subworkflows.md)

We introduce the representation of [subworkflow](../components/subworkflows.md) components [in this separate page](subworkflows.md).

## [Units](units.md)

The structured representation of compute [units](../components/units.md) is the object of a [separate discussion](units.md)
