# Searching for workflows

Clicking on the `Search` button  <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> on the workflows collection page will activate a search bar at the top of the workflows list. Through this search bar, the user is then free to enter any text string to search for and retrieve any desired workflow entry among those stored in the account-owned collection. Once the search string is entered, the search is then performed automatically by the workflows collection interface, with no further action needed from the user. To revert to the original complete workflows collection list once a search is completed, the search text string should be deleted. 
 
 Such searches can be based both upon the workflow's name, or the tags that have been associated with it at the moment of the workflow creation. 
 
# Animation
 
 In the example below, we demonstrate how to search for all workflows, among those present in our current collection, containing the keyword "band structure", upon entering this keyword string in the search bar at the top of the workflows collection page. Only one search result is returned in this particular instance, and the screen is then reverted to the original complete list of workflows after deleting the search string.
