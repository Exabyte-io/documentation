# Workflow cloning

The cloning (or copying) of a workflow present in the account-owned collection into a new distinct entry can be achieved as follows: first select the workflow entry by ticking its corresponding left-hand checkbox, and secondly click on the `Copy` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> which can be found on the top-right toolbar of the workflow collection page.
 
Alternatively, this cloning operation can be achieved directly through the `Copy` option under the three-dotted actions drop-down menu at the right-end of the workflow entry line that needs to be copied.

# Cloned workflow entry in collection

Once the copying operation is finished, a new separate entry with exactly the same content as the original workflow will be generated and included in the collection list just above the original workflow item. The initial name of this new clone workflow always defaults to the original name with the string "(clone)" appended to it. The user is then free to modify this name accordingly by first opening the new workflow clone in the Workflow Designer interface by clicking on its name, and then following the instructions in this [page](../workflow-designer/header-menu-actions.md) for editing the workflow name to a more memorable form and subsequently saving the changes. 

# Animation

We demonstrate how to execute a simple instance of workflow cloning in the animation below, where we clone a newly-created workflow still labelled "Empty Workflow" into a new distinct entry directly above it in the account-owned workflows collection:
