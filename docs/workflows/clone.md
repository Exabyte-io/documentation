# Clone / copy workflows

The cloning (or copying) of one or more workflows present in the account-owned collection into a new distinct entry can be achieved as follows: 

1. select one or multiple the workflow entries by ticking the corresponding checkboxes, 
2. click the `Copy` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the actions toolbar at the top of the workflows list
 
Alternatively, this cloning operation can be achieved directly through the `Copy` option action the three-dotted actions drop-down menu at the right-end of the workflow entry line that needs to be copied.

# Cloned workflow entry

## Finding cloned entry in the list

Once the copying operation is finished, a new separate entry with exactly the same content as the original will be generated and included in the list at the top (as the items in the list are sorted by the creation date by default). 

## Name of the cloned item

The initial name of this new clone workflow always defaults to the original name with the string "(clone)" appended to it. 

# Animation

We demonstrate how to execute a simple instance of workflow cloning in the animation below, where we clone a newly-created workflow still labelled "Empty Workflow" into a new distinct entry directly above it in the account-owned workflows collection:
