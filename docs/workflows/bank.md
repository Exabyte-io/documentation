# The Workflows Bank

The most common types of calculations routinely encountered have already been assembled in the form of pre-defined workflows, and are currently available for distribution in a central repository accessible to all users. We  refer to it as the Workflows Bank (to be compared with the equivalent Bank facility for pre-defined material structures documented [here](../materials/bank.md)). 
 
 Through such pre-built workflows, the user is therefore spared from having to re-implement computations such as the calculation of the total energy of crystals, of phonon dispersion curves, electronic band structures and similar.

# Animation

In the animation below, we demonstrate how to import a pre-defined workflow, which performs the electronic band structure calculation, from Workflows Bank into the account-owned collection. The workflow is retrieved from the Bank upon entering and searching for the "band structure" keywords in the search bar of the Bank page:
