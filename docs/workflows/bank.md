# Workflows Bank

We collect unique copies of all workflows in the "Workflows Bank" collection. The general features of a Bank are discussed in the following [introductory page](/entities-general/bank.md). We assert the uniqueness through the assessment of the sequence of logical operations and input as explained below.

# Pre-built Bank Workflows

Some common types of calculations routinely encountered have already been assembled in the form of pre-defined workflows, and are available among with the other user-created items in the Workflows Bank. Pre-built workflows let users quickly get up to speed with running simulations.

# Mapping Function

Workflows [Mapping Function](/entities-general/bank.md#bank-mapping-function) consists in an assessment of the sequence of logical operations and [application](/applications/modeling/overview.md) input files employed in the workflow and subsequent calculation of the [hash string](/entities-general/bank.md#hash-strings). The hash is then compared against those of existing Bank entries in the [same manner](/entities-general/bank.md) as for other bank entries. 

# Copy from Bank

The procedure of copying (or importing) Bank Workflows into Account-owned Workflows collection is described [here](actions/copy-bank.md).
