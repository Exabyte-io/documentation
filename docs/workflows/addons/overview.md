# Add-on Subworkflows

We allow for the insertion of **Add-on Subworkflows** for performing certain specialized calculations, such as convergence studies. These can be added from either the [Header Menu](../../workflow-designer/header-menu.md#inserting-add-ons) or the [Actions Menu](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/actions-menu.md#insert-add-ons) of the [Workflow Designer Interface](../../workflow-designer/overview.md).

## Convergence Studies

We explain the importance and implementation of convergence algorithms [here](convergence-algorithms.md).

## Structural Relaxation

Structural Relaxations are the object of a [dedicated discussion](structural-relaxation.md).
