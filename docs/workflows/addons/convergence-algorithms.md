# Convergence Algorithms

It is often required to test the convergence of [input computational parameters](../../methods/parameters.md) for the [method](../../methods/overview.md) under consideration, in order to achieve a certain [numerical precision](../../methods/precision.md) in the final results.

This feature is accessible as a stand-alone workflow, or as an [add-on](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/actions-menu.md#insert-add-ons) to an existing subworkflow in [Wokflow Designer](../../workflow-designer/overview.md).

For example, we explain how to add a [k-points](../../models/auxiliary-concepts/reciprocal-space/sampling.md) convergence test to a total energy subworkflow [in this page](../../models/auxiliary-concepts/reciprocal-space/convergence.md).
