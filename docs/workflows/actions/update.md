# Why update workflows?

As we explain [here](../bank.md), some of the most commonly encountered types of atomistic calculations in materials science have already been pre-packaged in the workflows "Bank", and can be imported directly by the user into the account-owned collection. When it happens the link between the Bank and user-owned item is retained.

Sometimes the Bank workflows are updated by our personnel. The user who had already imported a previous version of a particular Bank workflow can "Pull" the updates to his/her account-owned entry. 

# How to spot outdated workflows?

Any workflow in the account-owned collection can be recognized to be up-to-date with the current Bank repository version from the presence of a green check-mark, under the "Up-to-Date" column. Conversely, a red cross symbol indicates an outdated workflow that can needs an update. Some examples are given in the image below. 

> NOTE: the green check-mark label indicating a positive up-to-date condition is always displayed for all manually-created workflows in the collection, since Bank updates are not available for such workflows in any case.

# How to perform an Update?

This operation can be implemented through the corresponding `Update` tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-refresh zmdi-hc-border"></i>, accessible either via the top-right **toolbar** in the workflow collection page, or via the **drop-down** menu at the right-end of the corresponding workflow entry. In the former case, the workflow that needs to be updated first has to be selected through the ticking of its corresponding left-hand checkbox.
