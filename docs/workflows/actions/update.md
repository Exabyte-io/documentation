# Why Update Workflows?

As explained [here](../bank.md#pre-built-bank-workflows), some commonly encountered types of calculations are **pre-packaged** in the workflows "Bank". They can as such be imported directly by the user into the Account-owned collection. When this happens, the link between the Bank and Account-owned item is retained. Sometimes the *Pre-built Bank Workflows* are updated by our personnel. The user who had already imported a previous version of one of such workflows can then "Pull" the updates to his/her account-owned entry. 

# How to Spot Outdated Workflows?

Any workflow in the account-owned collection can be recognized to be up-to-date with its current Bank version from the presence of a green check-mark, under the "Up-to-Date" column. Conversely, a red cross symbol indicates an outdated status. Some examples are given in the image below. 

> NOTE: the green check-mark label indicating a positive up-to-date condition is always displayed for user-created workflows, since Bank updates are not available for them.

# How to Perform an Update?

Updating can be implemented through the corresponding `Update` tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-refresh zmdi-hc-border"></i>, accessible either via the top-right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) in the workflow collection page, or via the [actions drop-down](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown).
