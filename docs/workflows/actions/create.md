# New Workflow Creation

In order to create a new simulation workflow, click on "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top-right corner starting from the "Workflows" list. 

This will open the interface for creating a new workflow, which will henceforth be referred to as the "Workflow Designer". One can find instructions on how to use Workflow Designer interface in its dedicated [documentation chapter](../../workflow-designer/general-overview.md). 

# Animation

For a demonstration of how to enter the Workflow Designer to create a new workflow from scratch starting from the account-owned workflows collection, please take a look at the following animation:
