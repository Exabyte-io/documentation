# Changing default workflow

The initial default workflow when a new Exabyte account is opened amounts to a basic total energy materials calculation. As the user begins to grow the collection of workflows by creating new ones or importing them directly from the Bank, this default choice might subsequently need to be changed. We provide a general explanation of this defaulting procedure [here](../../general/actions/default.md).
