# Copy Workflows From Bank

The general procedure for importing entities from Banks is reviewed  [in this page](../../entities-general/actions/copy-bank.md).

In the animation below, we demonstrate how to import a Bank Workflow, performing the electronic band structure calculation, into the account-owned [collection](../../accounts/collections.md). The workflow is retrieved upon entering and searching for the "band structure" keywords in the [search bar](../../entities-general/actions/search.md).
