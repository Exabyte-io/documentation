A set of actions applicable to workflows is offered within the main "Workflow" list view.

The following set of actions pertaining to workflows is permitted, either via the **toolbar menu** located at the top-right corner of the page, or through the **drop-down menu** accessible under the three vertical dots at the right-end of each workflow entry in the list. Some of these actions are accessible via both menus. Click on the links below to access the corresponding documentation page:
