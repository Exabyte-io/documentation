# Workflow Actions

A set of actions applicable to workflows is offered within the main "Workflow" list view.

# Types of Actions

The following set of actions pertaining to workflows is permitted, either via the **toolbar menu** located at the top-right corner of the page, or through the **drop-down menu** accessible under the three vertical dots at the right-end of each workflow entry in the list. Some of these actions are in fact accessible via both menus. Click on each action icon directly in the image below to access the corresponding documentation page:

The precise location of both the toolbar and drop-down menus containing these action buttons within the wider workflow collection interface is further clarified in the panels emphasized in the image below:

# Importing from the Bank

Besides the above, workflows can be imported directly into the account-owned workflows collection from a central repository, referred to as the workflows "Bank". We explain how to do so in the following [documentation page](bank.md).
