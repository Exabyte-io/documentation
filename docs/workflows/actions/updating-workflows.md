# What is Workflow Updating?

## Import workflows from the Bank

As we explain [in this page](workflow-bank.md), the most commonly encountered types of atomistic calculations in materials science have already been pre-packaged in the workflows "Bank", and can be imported directly by the user into the account-owned collection of workflows. 

## The need for updating 

There might come a point in time at which the operational efficiency and performance of a pre-packaged workflow gets enhanced by our personnel, and these improvements are then made public to the entire user base by being incorporated directly into the existing entry within the Bank.
 
The user who had already imported a previous version of this workflow from the Bank into the account-owned workflows collection might then wish to "Download" such workflow performance updates directly into the existing collection entry. This possibility would certainly be more appealing than necessarily having to delete the current workflow entry from the collection, and then having to re-import a new copy of the workflow again from the Bank. 

# How to spot outdated workflows?

Any workflow in the account-owned collection can be recognized to be up-to-date with the current Bank repository version from the presence of a green check-mark along its entry line, under the "Up-to-Date" column of the workflow collection interface. Conversely, a red "X" symbol indicates an outdated workflow that can still potentially be synchronized with a more recent version made available in the Workflows Bank. 

> NOTE: the green check-mark label indicating a positive up-to-date condition is always displayed for all manually-created workflows in the collection, since Bank updates are not available for such workflows in any case.

Some examples of up-to-date or outdated workflow entries within the account-owned collection interface are portrayed in the image below, with the corresponding column of the interface making such a distinction possible specially highlighted:

# How to perform an Update?

This Bank update operation can be implemented through the corresponding `Update` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-rotate-ccw zmdi-hc-border"></i>, accessible either via the top-right toolbar in the workflow collection page, or via the three-dotted drop-down menu button at the right-end of the workflow entry line that needs updating. In the former case, the workflow that needs to be updated first has to be selected through the ticking of its corresponding left-hand checkbox. The user is then free to inspect the changes enacted in this workflow as a result of Exabyte's R&D efforts.

The user might recognize such an "Update" functionality from the general update features included in most software packages and operating systems under distribution today. The performance, security and user experience improvement philosophy behind such updates is in fact precisely the same.
