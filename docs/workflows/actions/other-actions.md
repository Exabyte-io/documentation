# Additional workflow actions

Further basic actions can be performed upon workflows directly from their collection page, in addition to those already introduced [elsewhere in the documentation](actions-intro.md). These additional actions in particular consist in the following:

# Deleting Workflows

To delete a workflow entry item from the collection list, simply select it by ticking its corresponding left-hand checkbox, and then press on the `Delete` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-delete zmdi-hc-border"></i> located in the actions toolbar at the top-right corner of the workflows collection page. Alternatively, the user can directly delete each workflow entry from the collection through the three-dotted drop-down menu button located at the right-end of each entry line.

# Changing default workflow

The initial default workflow when a new Exabyte account is opened amounts to a basic total energy materials calculation. As the user begins to grow the collection of workflows by creating new ones or importing them directly from the Bank, this default choice might subsequently need to be changed. 

This operation can be achieved by clicking on the `Set default` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-star-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the actions drop-down menu at the right-end of the workflow entry line that needs to be defaulted. The user will recognize this choice as being the default workflow for future operations by the check-mark assigned to it under the "Default" column of the workflows collection interface. 

> NOTE: a workflow cannot be deleted from the account-owned workflow collection for as long as it is set to be the default one. Only one workflow at a time can be set as default.
