## Editing Input

There are two ways to edit the input of an individual unit: either by editing the template inside the workflow (in this case **all** jobs created with this workflow will inherit the changes), or by editing the template or preview during job creation (in this case only one job, or multiple jobs created from the modified one, will have their input changed).
