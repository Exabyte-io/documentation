# Components of Workflows

We introduce here the components of [workflows](../overview.md).

## [Subworkflows](subworkflows.md)

The subworkflow component of workflow computations is the object of a [separate discussion](subworkflows.md).

## [Units](units.md)

Units constitute the most elementary form of computation present within a workflow, and they are reviewed [in this page](units.md).

## [Maps](maps.md)

The concept of maps for performing distributed computations is described [here](maps.md).
