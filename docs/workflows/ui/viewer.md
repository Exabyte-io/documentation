# Workflows Viewer Interface 

In order to inspect a workflow, the user can [open it](/entities-general/actions/open-edit.md) from the [Workflows Explorer](explorer.md).

# Viewer = Designer

In the case of workflows, the user interface and editing functionality of the Viewer is **exactly analogous** to that of the [Designer](/workflow-designer/general-overview.md). The user is therefore referred to the latter documentation page.
