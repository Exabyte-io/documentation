# Workflows Viewer Interface 

In order to inspect a workflow, the user can [open it](../../entities-general/actions/open-edit.md) from the [Workflows Explorer](explorer.md).

## Viewer = Designer

In the case of workflows, the user interface and editing functionality of the Viewer is **exactly** the same as that of the [Designer](../../workflow-designer/overview.md). The user is therefore referred to the latter documentation page for more details.
