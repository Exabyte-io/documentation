# Explorer interface of the Workflows collection page

The features of the main Explorer user interface which are specific to the Workflows page concern particularly the type of quantities and properties that can be displayed under the right-hand tabular section of the interface, highlighted in the image below. This image also explains how the available quantities or properties can be made visible in the interface under their corresponding columns, through the ticking of their corresponding entries in the top three-dotted [drop-down menu](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md):

In the above image, in particular, the properties exclusive to Materials are the ones which have been ticked already under the drop-down menu.
