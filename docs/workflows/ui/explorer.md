# Workflows Explorer Interface 

Following the [general introduction](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) to the Explorer Interface of our platform, it is worth highlighting a few special features which are exclusive to Workflows.

The image below shows an example of Explorer Interface used for visualizing a collection of Workflows, and for executing the various [general](/entities-general/actions/overview.md) or [workflow-specific](../actions/overview.md) actions:

# Up-to-date Indicators

In the above image, we highlight the area that indicates whether a workflow is [up-to-date](../actions/update.md) with respect to its corresponding Bank entry. A green check-mark indicates a positive up-to-date status, whereas a red cross means the opposite.

# Filter Workflows by Applications

Workflows can be [filtered](/entities-general/actions/search.md) (or searched) conventionally just like other types of entities with the possibility to be searched by the [application](/applications/overview.md) used inside them for performing the relevant computational tasks.
