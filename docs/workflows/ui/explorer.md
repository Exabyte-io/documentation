# Workflows Explorer

Following the [general introduction](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md) to the Explorer Interface, it is worth highlighting special features which are exclusive to Workflows.

The image below shows an example of Workflows Explorer, from which [general](/entities-general/actions/overview.md) or [workflow-specific](../actions/overview.md) actions can be executed.

# Up-to-date Indicators

In the above image, we highlight the area that indicates whether a workflow is [up-to-date](../actions/update.md) with respect to its corresponding Bank entry. A green check-mark indicates a positive up-to-date status, whereas a red cross means the opposite.

# Filter Workflows by Applications

Workflows can be [filtered (or searched)](/entities-general/actions/search.md) conventionally just like other types of entities. The possibility to search them by the [application](/software/overview.md) used within them, for performing the relevant computational tasks, also exists in this case.
