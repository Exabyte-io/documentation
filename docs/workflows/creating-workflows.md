There are two ways of creating workflows: from scratch or by cloning an existing workflow.

# From scratch

In order to create a new workflow one would need to navigate to "Workflows" page using the left-hand sidebar, and then click on "Create New" button - <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o"></i>. 

For the demonstration of how to add a Subworkflow/Unit see the animation below.
