# New Workflow Creation

In order to create a new workflow for performing general materials science calculations on any desired sample, click on the "Create" icon <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top-right corner starting from the "Workflows" page listing the account-owned workflows collection (this page is directly accessible via the left-hand sidebar of the Exabyte platform). 

This will open the interface for creating a new workflow, which will henceforth be referred to as the "Workflow Designer".

# Link to Workflow Designer documentation

You can find complete instructions on how to use this Workflow Designer interface in its dedicated [documentation chapter](../workflow-designer/general-overview.md).
