# Why the need to update existing workflows?

There might come a point in time at which the operational efficiency and performance of a workflow distributed by Exabyte as part of the Workflow Bank gets enhanced by our research personnel, and that these improvements are then made public to the entire Exabyte user base by being incorporated directly into the existing entry within the Bank.
 
 The user who had already imported a previous version of this workflow from the Bank into the account-owned workflows collection (following the procedure outlined [here](workflow-bank.md)) might then wish to "Download" such workflow performance updates directly into the existing collection entry. This possibility would certainly be more appealing than necessarily having to delete manually the current workflow entry from the collection, and then having to re-import a new copy of the workflow again from the Bank. 


# Updating Workflows

This `Update` operation is rendered rapid and easy by the corresponding update button <i class="zmdi zmdi-rotate-ccw zmdi-hc-border"></i>, accessible either via the top-right toolbar in the workflow collection page, or via the three-dotted drop-down menu button at the right-end of the workflow entry line that needs updating. In the former case, the workflow that needs to be updated first has to be selected through the ticking of its corresponding left-hand checkbox. The user is then free to inspect the changes implemented in this workflow as a result of Exabyte's R&D efforts.

The user might recognize such an "Update" functionality from the general update features included in most software packages and operating systems under distribution today. The performance, security and user experience improvement philosophy behind such updates is in fact precisely the same.
