# Exabyte RESTful API

Exabyte [RESTful](#Links) API (or REST-API) is a software architectural style that allows to access and manipulate textual representations of Exabyte web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. In other words, REST-API provides programmatic access to data and functionality for data scientists and engineers, and anyone who prefers coding to the user interface.

In order to use REST-API one should form authenticated queries through a RESTful API client. Below we refers the readers to sections explaining authentication parameters, requests and responses structure, endpoints, REST-API client and examples.

## Authentication

[Authentication](authentication.md) section explains how to authenticate and access the API.

## Query Structure

[Query Structure](query-structure.md) section provides information about REST-API requests and responses.

## Endpoints

[Endpoints](endpoints.md) section contains information about different API versions and how to access endpoints under a particular version.

## Exabyte API Client

[Exabyte API client](exabyte-api-client.md) section explains how to access REST-API via Python.

## Exabyte API Examples

[Exabyte API examples](exabyte-api-examples.md) section contains Jupyter Notebooks to perform most-common tasks via REST-API.
