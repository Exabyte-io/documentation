# RESTful API

[RESTful](#links) API (or REST-API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a layer allows to access and manipulate textual representation of the web resources (eg. [Entities](../entities-general/overview.md)) by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. In other words, REST-API provides **programmatic** access to data and functionality for data scientists and engineers, and anyone else who prefers coding to the user interface.

## Operation

The recommended way use the API is to form authenticated queries through a client. Below we refers the readers to sections explaining authentication parameters, requests and response structure, endpoints, API client and examples.

## Authentication

[Authentication](authentication.md) section explains how to authenticate and access the API.

## Query Structure

[Query Structure](query-structure.md) section provides information about REST-API requests and responses.

## Endpoints

[Endpoints](endpoints.md) section contains information about different API versions and how to access endpoints under a particular one.

## API Client

[API client](exabyte-api-client.md) section explains how to access REST-API via Python.

## API Examples

[API examples](exabyte-api-examples.md) section contains examples of performing the most common tasks.
