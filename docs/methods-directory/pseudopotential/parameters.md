# Pseudopotential Method Parameters

## Type

Pseudopotential

## Subtype

The following types of pseudopotentials are supported on our platform.

- Ultra-Soft (`us`)
- Norm-Conserving (`nc`) 
- Projector-Augmented Wave (`paw`) 

## [Precision](precision.md)

As explained [here](precision.md).

!!! note "Exchange-correlation Functionals"
    The type of Exchange correlation functional for the pseudopotential is defined by the model functional parameter. Please consult [this page](../../models-directory/dft/overview.md) for a review of the available pseudopotential **functionals**, implementing different approximations for the **exchange-correlation**.
