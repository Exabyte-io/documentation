Our platform provides the GBRV [^5] pseudopotential set at version 1.5 by default for the applications supporting the unified pseudopotential format (UPF).

For [VASP](../../software-directory/modeling/vasp.md) we provide the 

The list of pseudopotentials currently available on the Quantum ESPRESSO website can be found in Ref [^4] below.
