# Plane-Waves Pseudopotential Method

The Plane-waves Pseudopotential Method is based upon the implementation of plane-waves as a basis set for representing the electronic wavefunctions of a material [^1], as well as the adoption of pseudopotentials [^2].
 
This method is widely used as an effective algorithmic recipe for the computational formulation and implementation of the [DFT theoretical model](../../models-directory/dft/overview.md).  

## [Parameters](parameters.md)

[This page](parameters.md) contains a list of the fundamental computational parameters involved in the Plane-waves Pseudopotential Method.

## [Actions](actions.md)

We introduce [here](actions.md) the action for uploading a custom Pseudopotential file to our platform via the [Subworkflow Editor Interface](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md). 

## [Precision](precision.md)

We discuss the parameters that limit the [numerical precision](../../methods/precision.md) of the plane-waves pseudopotential method [here](precision.md).

## [Structured Representation](data.md)

[This page](data.md) contains an example [structured representation](../../data-structured/overview.md) for the method.

## [Important Settings](important-settings.md)

We explain [under this page](important-settings.md) how important settings concerning the method can be set under the [Subworkflow Editor Interface](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md) of [Workflow Designer](../../workflow-designer/overview.md).
