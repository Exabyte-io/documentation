# Define Training Data Set

By default, the training data set for [Machine Learning](../../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md) applications is generated based on the [selected materials](../../jobs-designer/actions-header-menu/select-materials.md) in [job designer](../../jobs-designer/overview.md).

## Upload Data Set

The user can also upload a new training data set to a machine learning [Workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) by clicking upon the `Choose File` button, located under the "Data Set" section of the [Overview Tab](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview-tab.md) within the [Subworkflow Editor Interface](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md).
