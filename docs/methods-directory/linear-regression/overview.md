# Linear Regression Method

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).
 
This method is widely used as an effective algorithmic formulation and implementation of the [Machine Learning model](../../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md).  

## [Parameters](parameters.md)

[This page](parameters.md) contains a list of the fundamental computational parameters involved in the Linear Regression Method.

## [Structured Representation](data.md)

[This page](data.md) contains an example [structured representation](../../data-structured/overview.md) for the method.
