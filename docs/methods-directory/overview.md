# List of Available Methods

We present here a list of computational [methods](../methods/overview.md) implemented on our platform to date.

## [Plane-wave Pseudopotential](../methods-directory/pseudopotential/overview.md)

We consider the **Plane-wave Pseudopotential** approach towards implementing the [Density Functional Theory](../models-directory/dft/parameters.md) model as our primary method. This method is introduced in the [following section](../methods-directory/pseudopotential/overview.md) of the documentation.
