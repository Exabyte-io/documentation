# List of Available Methods

We present here a list of computational [methods](../methods/overview.md) implemented on our platform to date.

## [Plane-wave Pseudopotential](pseudopotential/overview.md)

We consider the **Plane-wave Pseudopotential** approach towards implementing the [Density Functional Theory](../models-directory/dft/overview.md) model as our primary method. This method is introduced in the [following section](pseudopotential/overview.md) of the documentation.

## [Linear Regression](linear-regression/overview.md)

We also provide an implementation of the **Linear Regression** method for [Machine Learning](../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md) applications, which is discussed [in this section](linear-regression/overview.md).
