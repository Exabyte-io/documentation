# Structured Data

In this section, we provide an introduction to the practices we employ to store **structured data** in our database. Structured data is stored according to the **Exabyte Data Convention** (internal-only at the moment, available to interested parties on a case-by-case basis). 

## Convention

[This section](convention.md) contains the explanation of the basics of the convention employed. We particularly explain how we make use of the **JSON format** for storing structured representations of [entities](../entities-general/overview.md), and of their respective [properties](../properties/overview.md). We also introduce the concept of **JSON schemas**.
