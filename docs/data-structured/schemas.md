# Schemas & Examples

Different **schemas** are available on our platform for describing the [structured data](overview.md) associated with different [Materials properties](/properties/overview.md). In computer science, a schema is a general concept referring to how structured data can be stored and organized within a database.

# Gateway to Materials Data Convention

We refer the reader to the documentation dedicated to the Materials Data Convention [[1](#links)] for a detailed explanation of the schemas which pertain to the structured data stored and employed on the Exabyte platform.
