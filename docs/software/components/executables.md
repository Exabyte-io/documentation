# Executables

[Applications](../applications.md) are typically run via the launching of their respective **executable binary files** [^1] (more simply referred to as **executables**), of which there may be just one or multiple.

## Example

The [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso.md) modeling application for example is comprised of the following main input executables [^2], included as part of its distribution package, such as `pw.x`, `ph.x`, `bands.x` etc.

!!!warning "Executables available on our platform"
    Only a subset of the above executables have been implemented on our platform so far, as can be deduced from the list of available executables under the [Unit Editor Interface](../../workflow-designer/unit-editor.md#application). Submit a [support request] in case you'd 

Other applications such as [VASP](../../software-directory/modeling/vasp.md) on the other hand contain just a single main executable, through which all of its supported computation features can be performed.
