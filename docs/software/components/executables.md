# Executables

[Applications](../applications.md) are typically run via the launching of their respective **executable binary files** [^1] (more simply referred to as **executables**), of which there may be just one or multiple.

## Example

The [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso.md) modeling application for example is comprised of several main input executables, included as part of its distribution package, such as `pw.x`, `ph.x`, `bands.x` etc.

Other applications such as [VASP](../../software-directory/modeling/vasp.md) on the other hand contain just a single main executable, through which all of its supported computation features can be performed.
