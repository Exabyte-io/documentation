# Structural Analysis and Visualization Tools

Materials can be **visualized** with the help of specialized computer software assisting the user to graphically inspect and understand them. These software are typically interacted with through the help of a graphical user interface under a desktop environment, such as the [Remote Desktop](../../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md) functionality provided on our platform.

The picture below shows the typical graphical output and rendering of such crystal structure visualization software. This example image represents the case of a material comprising two different types of elements, each represented by a spherical ball of different size and color and interconnected by sticks representing the chemical bonds between them (the so-called **Ball-and-stick model** [^1]).

## Further Functionality

These structural visualization software tools also typically provide further **structural analysis functionality** that can be applied to better understand the physical and chemical properties of the material being inspected. Such functionality might for example include the possibility to computationally simulate the X-ray or Neutron scattering diffraction patterns, as would be encountered during experimental investigations on the material.

A typical user session using the [VESTA](../../software-directory/analysis/vesta.md) tool in a desktop environment, both for crystal visualization and structural analysis purposes via multiple panels opened simultaneously, might appear as shown in the example below.
