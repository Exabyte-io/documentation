# Analysis Software

Materials can be analyzed with the help of specialized computer software assisting the user to, for example, graphically inspect and understand them. Analysis tools can be applied to better understand the physical and chemical properties of the material being inspected. Such functionality might for example include the possibility to computationally simulate the X-ray or Neutron scattering diffraction patterns, as would be encountered during experimental investigations performed on the material.

## Implementation

We enable support for several analysis (and visualization) tools. which are accessible primarily via our [Remote Desktop Environment](../../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md) or [Command Line Interface](../../remote-connection/overview.md). The tools are introduced [in this section](../../software-directory/overview.md) of the documentation.
