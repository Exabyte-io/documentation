# Machine Learning

[Machine learning](../../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md) relates to algorithms and statistical models that computers can use to progressively improve with time their performance in solving certain problems. 

## Implementation

We have a proof-of-concept support for Machine Learning within our platform as a way to do predictive modeling of materials, as mentioned [in this section](../../software-directory/overview.md#machine-learning) of the documentation.

A Machine Learning [workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) typically consists of the following multiple steps.

1. Generating the training data set
2. Manipulating the data (removing none values, duplicates, etc)
3. Transforming the data (scaling, etc.)
4. Selecting the best features (regression, etc.)
5. Building the ML train model
6. Predicting new properties from the trained model

The user is referred to the tutorial section on machine learning for more detailed information on the above steps.
