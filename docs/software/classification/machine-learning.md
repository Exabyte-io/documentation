# Machine Learning

Machine learning relates to algorithms and statistical models that computers can use to progressively improve with time their performance in solving certain problems [^1]. 

## Implementation

We have a proof-of-concept support for Machine Learning within our platform as a way to do predictive modeling of materials, as mentioned [in this section](../../software-directory/overview.md#machine-learning) of the documentation.
