# Software Classification

We classify software based upon the following categories.

## Structural Analysis and Visualization Tools

The crystal structures involved in material modeling simulations can be analyzed and visualized graphically with the help of dedicated software tools, which are described [in this page](analysis.md).

## Development Tools

New modeling applications typically need to be compiled and installed with an appropriate set of compilers and libraries, which are commonly referred to together as development tools. They are the object of [this discussion](development.md).

## Machine Learning

A machine learning engine is incorporated on our platform, and is described [here](machine-learning.md).

## Modeling Engines

Modeling software constitute the main engine driving the conduction of material modeling simulations, and are introduced [in this page](modeling.md).

## Scripting

We introduce the concept of scripting, which is also supported on our platform, in [this other page](scripting.md).
