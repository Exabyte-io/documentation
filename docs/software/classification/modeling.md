# Modeling Engines

Material Modeling engines are used in computational materials science to implement the [computational methods](../../methods/overview.md) available for calculating [material properties](../../properties/overview.md) of interest [^1] [^2]. 

These engines may be based on such [theoretical models](../../models/overview.md) as Hartree-Fock Theory, Density Functional Theory (DFT), classical Molecular Dynamics, Quantum Monte Carlo or semi-empirical Quantum Chemistry methods. They can be of either open-source or proprietary nature, and are typically comprised of numerous [executables](../components/executables.md), for implementing the different computation [flavors](../components/flavors.md) that they were designed to support.
