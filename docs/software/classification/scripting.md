# Scripting Languages

A scripting language [^1] is a programming language that supports **scripts**, or programs that automate the execution of common computational tasks. Scripting languages are often **interpreted**, rather than compiled. 

## Implementation

We provide support for several scripting languages on our platform, which are introduced [in this section](../../software-directory/overview.md) of the documentation.
