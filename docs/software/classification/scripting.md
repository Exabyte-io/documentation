# Scripting Languages

A scripting language [^1] is a programming language that supports **scripts**, or programs that automate the execution of common computational tasks. Scripting languages are often **interpreted**, rather than compiled. 

## Structured Representations

We present in what follows the [JSON-based structured representations](../../data-structured/overview.md) for those scripting languages that are [supported on our platform](../../software-directory/overview.md).

### Shell Scripting

This is the structured representation for the [Shell](../../software-directory/scripting/shell.md) scripting language.

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/software/scripting/shell.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!example/software/scripting/shell.json!}
```

### Python

The data structure for the [Python](../../software-directory/scripting/python.md) scripting language can be found below.

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/software/scripting/python.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!example/software/scripting/python.json!}
```
