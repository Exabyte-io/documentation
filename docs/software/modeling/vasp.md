# Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, better known as VASP, is a package for performing ab-initio electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics, using either Vanderbilt ultra-soft pseudopotentials or the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, together with a plane wave basis set. 

The underlying theoretical model is Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the code also allows for the use of post-DFT corrections, such as hybrid functionals mixing DFT and Hartreeâ€“Fock exchange, many-body perturbation theory (the GW method), and dynamical electronic correlations within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).

Complete information and documentation about the VASP code can be found in its corresponding website [^1], [^2], [^3]

!!! note "Default Pseudopotentials"
    As mentioned in the [dedicated section](../../methods-directory/pseudopotential/default.md), the list of default pseudopotentials follows the versions of the VASP software itself (versions 5.2 and 5.4).
