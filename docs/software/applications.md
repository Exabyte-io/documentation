# Applications

The concept of **"Software Application"** is related to the main **modeling engine** and associated software tools employed by the user for the design, execution and postprocessing of a [simulation Job](../jobs/overview.md), through the implementation of any of the available [computational methods](../methods/overview.md). 

## Executables and Flavors

Each application may be comprised of one or multiple [Executables](components/executables.md), implementing in turn different possible computation [Flavors](components/flavors.md). These settings can be entered within the [unit editor interface](../workflow-designer/unit-editor.md#application).
