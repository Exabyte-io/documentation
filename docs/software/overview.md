# Software

We review in the present section of the documentation the most important general concepts underlying the **Software** comprised within the scope of our platform. This software is necessary for performing such tasks as executing materials modeling simulations, or for analyzing and visualizing their corresponding output. 

## [List of Available Software](../software-directory/overview.md)

The reader is referred to [this alternative section](../software-directory/overview.md) of the documentation for a complete list and review of the specific software packages available for use on our platform.

## [Components](components.md)

We introduce the concepts of an [application](components.md), and of its constituent [executables](components.md#executables) and different possible computation [flavors](components.md#flavors) respectively.

## [Classification](classification/overview.md)

We classify software into a set of distinct categories, as narrated [in this section](classification/overview.md) of the documentation.

## [Data](data.md)

We provide a list of [JSON-based structured representations](../data-structured/overview.md) for applications, and for each of their components, [in this page](data.md).
