# Software

We review in the present section of the documentation the most important general concepts underlying the **Software** comprised within the scope of our platform. This software is necessary for performing such tasks as executing materials modeling simulations, or for analyzing and visualizing their corresponding output. Each page introduced herein also provides an example of [structured representation](../data-structured/overview.md) for the entity being discussed, formulated upon the general framework of the **Exabyte Data Convention**.

The reader is referred to [this alternative section](../software-directory/overview.md) of the documentation for a complete list and review of the specific software packages available for use on our platform.

## Modeling Applications

We introduce the concepts of a [modeling application](modeling/applications.md), and of its constituent [executables](modeling/executables.md) and different possible computation [flavors](modeling/flavors.md), in their respective pages.

## Structural Analysis and Visualization Tools

The crystal structures involved in material modeling simulations can be analyzed and visualized graphically with the help of dedicated software tools, which are described [in this page](analysis.md).

## Development Tools

New modeling applications typically need to be compiled and installed with an appropriate set of compilers and libraries, which are commonly referred to together as development tools. They are the object of [this discussion](development.md).

## Machine Learning

A machine learning engine is incorporated on our platform, and is described [here](machine-learning.md).

## Scripting

We introduce the concept of scripting, which is also supported on our platform, in [this other page](scripting.md).
