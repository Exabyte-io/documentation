# Actions for Jobs via Command Line

In the present section of the documentation, we review the most frequently encountered actions which are necessary for the [execution of Jobs via the Command Line Interface (CLI)](../overview.md) of our platform. 

## [Create New Jobs](create.md)

We introduce some simple instructions on how the user can run some pre-defined simulation examples via CLI [in this page](create.md). These instructions are intended to get the user rapidly up to speed with the core functioning and features of our [CLI](../../cli/overview.md). More detailed explanations for understanding the possibility of advanced job customization on our platform can be retrieved under a [dedicated tutorial](../../tutorials/jobs-cli/job-cli-example.md).

## [Submit Job](submit.md)

We explain the commands necessary for **submitting jobs** to the CLI [here](submit.md).

## [Check Job Status](check-status.md)

The status of jobs can be inspected at any time via CLI by following [these instructions](check-status.md).

## [Terminate Job](terminate.md)

A Job can be terminated artificially by the user at any time preceding its completion [as follows](terminate.md)

## [View List of Jobs and Charges](view-job-list.md)

A detailed list of Jobs and associated [Accounting Charges](../../accounts/payments-charges.md) produced to date by the user can be generated under CLI as explained [here](view-job-list.md), for user's reference and convenience.
