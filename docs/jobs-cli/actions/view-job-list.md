# Detailed List of Jobs and Charges

To get detailed information about all the [jobs](../overview.md) [submitted](../overview.md) **to date** by the user on the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md) (CLI) of our system, the `lsjob` command should be entered, as displayed in the example below.
 
This information includes the relevant [compute parameters](../../infrastructure/compute/parameters.md) used as part of the job execution, as well as the [Project](../../jobs/projects.md) container and [Account Charges](../../accounts/payments-charges.md) incurred by each listed Job. Here, the Jobs are referenced by their **"Job IDs"**, as well as by their IDs attributed by the accounting system. 

## Example

The example below demonstrates how to list all jobs for the current user, executed within a certain time period.

```bash
# > lsjob -s 2019-01-08 -e 2019-02-08`
Id     JobId User  Project               Machine                                           Queue QualityOfService Stage   Charge   Processors Nodes WallDuration StartTime           EndTime             Description
