# Jobs via Command Line Interface

The present section of the documentation explains how [simulation Jobs](../jobs/overview.md) can be created and executed via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../cli/overview.md) of our platform.

## Batch script

We explain how to compose **Batch Scripts** (also known as **Job Scripts**), necessary for job submission via CLI, [in this section](batch-scripts/overview.md).

## Accounting

We describe the accounting aspects of Job submission via CLI, such as specifying [Projects](../jobs/projects.md) and inspecting the [Account charges and balance](../accounts/overview.md), [here](accounting.md).

## Actions

The actions pertaining to Jobs submission and execution under the CLI are reviewed [in this section](actions/overview.md) of the documentation. Other general actions concerning the CLI, such as the loading of modules, the compilation of new applications or the creation of new python environments, are described [separately](../cli/actions/overview.md).

## Tutorials

We provide tutorials guiding the user through the complete procedure for submitting jobs via CLI, and subsequently retrieving the corresponding results under the [Web Interface](../ui/overview.md) of our platform. These tutorials are introduced [here](../tutorials/jobs-cli/overview.md).
