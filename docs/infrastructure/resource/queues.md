# Queues

Different task scheduling **Queues** are available under each [speed category](category.md), for accessing the [computational clusters](../clusters/overview.md) and executing [simulation Jobs](../../jobs/overview.md) upon them. These queues afford for the allocation of different amounts of **computational resources** (number of cores).

## Available Options 

Here, we present a table of all the possible queue options, with an indication of how many CPU cores are available under each of them.
