# Connection Options

The [login node](overview.md) of our platform can be accessed via any of the following **connection methods**.

## SSH Terminal 

The user can use an **external SSH client** under any Operating System to connect to our [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md). We explain how to do so in [this page](../../remote-connection/ssh.md).

## Web Terminal

Alternatively, we offer an incorporated Terminal within our Web Interface which also takes the user to the same [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md). We refer to this as the [Web Terminal](../../remote-connection/web-terminal.md).

It can be accessed via the corresponding option under the main [right-hand sidebar](../../ui/right-sidebar.md) of the user interface.

## Remote Desktop

If the user wants to experience a fully graphical desktop environment, he can do so via the [Remote Desktop Application](../../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md).

Similarly to Web Terminal, Remote Desktop can also be accessed via the [right-hand sidebar](../../ui/right-sidebar.md) of the user interface.
