# Platform Architecture

Our product is build out of multiple microservices that together form a distributed web application that can be deployed both on public- and private cloud infrastructure. We aggregate multiple computing clusters that in turn can be deployed in shared- and single-occupancy modes depending on customer preference. 

The diagram below demonstrates an example hybrid cloud deployment:
