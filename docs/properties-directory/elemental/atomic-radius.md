# Atomic Radius

The atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms, and gives a typical indication of the distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons. 

The atomic radii can be found tabulated for elements across the Periodic Table [^1].
