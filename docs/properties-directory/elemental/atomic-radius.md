# Atomic Radius

Atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms, and gives a typical indication of the distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons [^1]. 

The atomic radii can be found tabulated for elements across the [Periodic Table](../../properties/data/periodic-table.md).

## Schema

The JSON schema and an example representation for this property can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#atomic-radius).
