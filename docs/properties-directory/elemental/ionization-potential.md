# Ionization Energy

The ionization energy (or potential) is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to remove the most loosely-bound valence electron of an isolated atom of an element [^1].

Values for the ionization energies can be found tabulated for elements across the [Periodic Table](../../properties/data/periodic-table.md).

## Schema

The JSON schema and an example representation for this property can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#ionization-potential).
