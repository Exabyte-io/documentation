# Electronegativity

The Electronegativity of an element is a chemical property that describes the tendency of its atoms to attract electrons towards itself, for example in the context of the sharing of electrons involved in chemical bonding between atoms. Electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons towards itself.
