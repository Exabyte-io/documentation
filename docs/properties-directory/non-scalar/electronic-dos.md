# Electronic Density of States

The Density of States of the material describes the number of states per an interval of energy at each energy level available to be occupied [^1].

## Computation

The final results for the computed electronic Density of States are also presented graphically in the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md).

The typical appearance of such a Density of States plot for electronic bandstructures is shown below. Here, the possibility to print or download the graph in different image formats is offered under the top-right button.

In this graph, the total density of states is marked by the black line. Individual contributions are labelled with different colors, as explained in the legend below the graph. The [Fermi level](../scalar/total-energy.md#fermi-energy) is set by the vertical red dashed line.

## Schema and Example 

The JSON schema and an example representation for this property can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#density-of-states).
