# Phonons

The results of phonon lattice vibration calculations [^1] are presented in a similar fashion to those for the [electronic bandstructure](bandstructure.md), in the form of a frequency dispersion plot across the reciprocal space of the Brillouin Zone of the crystal. 

## Computation

An example of such a phonon dispersion plot, as presented under the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md), is shown below.

The possibility to print or download the dispersion graph in different image formats is offered, under the button labelled with three horizontal bars at the top-right corner of the panel shown above.

## Schema and Example 

The JSON schema and an example representation for this property can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#phonon-dispersions).
