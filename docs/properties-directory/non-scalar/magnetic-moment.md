# Magnetic Moment

The calculation of Magnetic Moments is especially relevant in the context of **Ferromagnetic Materials** [^1], such as iron, nickel, cobalt and most of their alloys. These represent any material that exhibits **spontaneous magnetization**, in the form a **net magnetic moment** in the absence of an external magnetic field.

The Magnetic Moment is a **[Vector, Characteristic and Physical](../../properties/classification/general.md) property** of the [Material](../../materials/overview.md) under consideration.

## Computation

The magnetic moment can be computed by inserting the corresponding [Workflow Modifier](../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md).

It is returned to the user as a vector (one for each atom present in the material) as portrayed below, under the interface of the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md). Its final value is expressed in units of bohr magnetons.
