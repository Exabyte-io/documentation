# Phonon Density of States

The Density of States for the case of lattice vibrations [^1] describes the number of available states across an interval of phonon frequency.

## Computation

The final results for the computed phonon Density of States are also presented graphically in the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md). 

An example of such a Density of States plot is shown below. Here, the possibility to print or download the graph in different image formats is offered under the top-right button.
