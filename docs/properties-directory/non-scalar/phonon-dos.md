# Phonon Density of States

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Non-Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Vibrational</span>

The Density of States for the case of lattice vibrations [^1] describes the number of available states across an interval of phonon frequency.

## Example

The final results for the computed phonon Density of States are also presented graphically in the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md). 

An example of such a Density of States plot is shown below.

### Export as Image

The possibility to export the graph is offered as mentioned [here](../../properties/ui/viewer.md#export-as-images).

## Schema 

The JSON schema and an example representation for this property can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#phonon-density-of-states).
