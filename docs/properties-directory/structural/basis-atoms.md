# Crystal Atoms

The individual atoms in a Crystal Structure are arranged periodically in three-dimensions according to a **repeating unit**, or **[basis](final-structure.md)**, set of atoms which may correspond to different chemical **elements**. They give the solid structure a finite strength against deformation through the **chemical bonds** linking them together, whose nature can be ionic, covalent, metallic etc [^1]. 

## Example Atomic Structure

A typical example of an atomic arrangement within a material is given by the cubic-diamond crystal structure displayed below. This represents the underlying structural framework of crystalline materials such as Carbon (in the diamond phase), Silicon and Germanium. Atoms are shown here as dark balls, connected by white tubes representing the covalent bonds between them.

## Atomic Positions

The atomic positions, defining the atom's geometric arrangement within the structure, can be defined and entered in the [basis editor](../../materials-designer/source-editor/basis.md) of [Materials Designer](../../materials-designer/overview.md), as separate three-dimensional vectors. Each vector labels the position of the corresponding atom within the unit cell of the crystal, expressed under either a fractional or Cartesian coordinate system.
