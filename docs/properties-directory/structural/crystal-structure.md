The complete **crystal structure** [^1] of a crystalline [material](../../materials/overview.md) is obtained when a [set of atoms](basis.md), known as the **basis atoms** or **repeating unit**, are convolved (combined) with each one of the lattice points of the underlying [Bravais lattice](lattice.md). 

This convolution gives the crystal structure its [space group](space-group.md) symmetry assignment.

## Visualization

The image below outlines the crystal structure definition conceptually.
