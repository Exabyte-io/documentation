# Reaction Energy Barrier

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Chemical</span>

The Reaction Energy Barrier (also known as Activation Barrier) marks the highest energy state encountered during the course of the progress of a chemical reaction [^1], as visualized through its corresponding [Reaction Energy Profile](../non-scalar/reaction-energy-profile.md). It is a **[Scalar and Auxiliary](../../properties/classification/general.md) property** of the chemical reaction under consideration. It therefore effectively measures the **energetic requirement** that the reactants need to overcome in order to undergo a complete transformation into the products of the chemical reaction.

## Example

Its value can be estimated with any [Nudged Elastic Band](../../tutorials/dft/chemical/reaction-profile-qe.md) (NEB) [Workflow](../../workflows/overview.md), and it is returned under the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) interface with the following appearance (in eV).
