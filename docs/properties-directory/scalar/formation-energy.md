# Formation Energy

The formation energy represents the energetic cost of creating a **defect** into an otherwise perfect solid structure. For example, for the case of a vacancy defect, it is calculated as the energy needed to remove the corresponding atom from the bulk.

    The calculation of Formation energies is not yet available as a Workflow computation on our platform.
