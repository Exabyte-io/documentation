# Formation Energy

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Thermodynamic</span>

The formation energy represents the energetic cost of creating a **defect** into an otherwise perfect solid structure. For example, for the case of a vacancy defect, it is calculated as the energy needed to remove the corresponding atom from the bulk. 

!!!note "Note: feature not implemented yet"
    The calculation of Formation energies is not yet available as a Workflow computation on our platform.
