# Average Pressure

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Thermodynamic</span>

We define the **Average Pressure** $p_{avg}$ of a Material as a **[Scalar and Physical](../../data-structured/overview.md) property** obtained from the following conventional formula.

$$
p_{avg}=-\frac{1}{3} \mathrm{Tr} \hspace{1pt} {\boldsymbol{\sigma}}
$$ 

where ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is the [internal stress tensor](../non-scalar/stress-tensor.md) of the solid, and $\mathrm{Tr}$ indicates the Trace operator in linear algebra [^1]. 

## Example

The average pressure can be computed as part of any [Workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) involving at least one basic "self-consistent field" (scf) total energy calculation in [DFT](../../models/dft/overview.md). 

It is then presented to the user, as part of the output of a [Job](../../jobs/overview.md), with the following appearance under the interface of the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md). Its final value is expressed in units of kilobars (kbar).
