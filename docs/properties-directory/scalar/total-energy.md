# Total Energy

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Electronic</span>

The "Total Energy" refers to the total electronic ground state energy of a material with a fixed lattice (with no thermal vibrations of the atoms). It is an important example of an **[Auxiliary](../../properties/classification/general.md) property** of [Materials](../../materials/overview.md), and is routinely calculated during the course of material science simulations. 

## Examples

The total energy can be calculated by a corresponding workflow. For [DFT](../../models-directory/dft/overview.md) calculations, for example, any [Workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) containing a unit with a "self-consistent field" (scf) type can extract total energy. 

It is presented to the user, as part of the output of a [Job](../../jobs/overview.md), with the appearance displayed below, under the interface of the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of the [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md). Its final value is expressed in units of electronVolt (eV).

## Total Energy Contributions

The Total Energy of a Material is comprised of several **Energy Contributions**. They are returned as a list of [Scalar and Auxiliary](../../properties/classification/general.md) quantities.

## Types of Contributions

Specific types of energy contributions are commonly encountered in [DFT](../../models-directory/dft/overview.md) computations [^1], [^2]. The types included in the final results depend specifically on the modeling [application](../../software/parameters.md) employed, as explained in what follows.

The reader is referred to the links presented at the bottom of the page for a theoretical review of the energy contributions presented herein.

## By Application

### Generic

The following contributions, displayed in the image below, are computed and returned to the user under the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md), for the cases of both [VASP](../../software-directory/modeling/vasp.md) and [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso.md) calculations. In all instances, the results are returned in units of eV.

### Quantum ESPRESSO

Two additional energy contributions can be evaluated with Quantum ESPRESSO-based Workflows: the "One-electron" and "Harris-Foulkes" contributions [^3]. They are both returned as values expressed in eV, in a similar format to the other properties listed in the above image.
