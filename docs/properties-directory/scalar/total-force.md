# Total Force

Similarly to the [average pressure](pressure.md), the **Total Force** is also treated as a Scalar, [Characteristic and Physical](../../properties/classification/general.md) property, defined as the norm (or magnitude) of the net vector sum of the individual [atomic forces](../structural/basis-atoms.md), summed across all atoms present in the crystal structure under consideration.

## Computation

This material property is displayed under the [Results Tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md) as follows, in units of eV/Angstroms. It it also routinely computed as part of any total energy self-consistent field (scf) calculation using [DFT](../../models/dft/overview.md).
