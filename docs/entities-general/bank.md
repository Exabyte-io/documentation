# Materials and Workflows Bank

Pre-defined Materials and Workflows can be directly imported from their respective central database repositories, referred to as "Banks" in the context of our Platform.  Specific examples on how to operate this import procedure from the Bank repositories can be found for both [Materials](/materials/bank.md) and [Workflows](/workflows/bank.md) in their respective documentation pages.

For accounts with private data and  elevated service levels, the corresponding entries in the various Banks are private and only visible to the members of the account. For the rest - the bank entries are visible to all platform users. 


# Open Bank Page 

In order to import entities of type "Material" or "Workflow" from their respective Bank repositories into the account-owned collection of that particular entity type, first click on the corresponding `Bank` option in the [left-hand sidebar menu](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md) of the User Interface. After the first click, the choice between navigating to either of the Materials or Workflows Banks is offered to the user. The user will be presented with a comprehensive list of centrally-stored and pre-defined Workflows or Materials, depending on the selected option.

# Search for material

The list of banked entities can be conveniently searched through with the help of the [search text bar](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top of the Bank page.

# Copy to account collection

To import entities from the Bank into the user's account-owned collection, the user should first select the desired entry items by ticking their respective checkboxes at the start of the corresponding entry lines, and then click on `Copy` <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right taskbar of the Bank page.
