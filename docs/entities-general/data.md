# Structured Data Representation of Entities

We store each item contained in the entity collections under our database in the form of **structured data**, using the JSON format [[1](#links)]. 

The user is referred to the relevant [section of the documentation](/data/convention/structured.md) for an in-depth explanation of structured data in the context of our platform.

# Example JSON representation

The following is an example of JSON structured representation of an entity item contained in an Account-owned collection, where only the general keywords applicable to all [entity types](overview.md) have been preserved. 

The reader is referred to other documentation pages for aspects that might pertain specifically to [Materials](/materials/data.md), [Workflows](/workflows/data/data.md) and [Jobs](/jobs/data.md) respectively.

# Explanation of Keywords

## Top-level Keywords

| Keyword    |  Short Description      | Details        | 
| :-------- |:----------- |:------------- |
| _id | Identifier in Account-owned Entity Collection    |  Each entity contained in an Account-owned collection has a unique Collection Identifier code, attributed by our platform. |
| name | Name of Entity | Entity's human-readable name in Account-owned Collection. |
| owner / creator | Entity Owner and Creator | Further information about both the Account [owning](ownership.md) the entity, and about the user who created it in the first place, is also contained in the entity's structured representation as two separate nested JSON **Objects**. These are described separately in the other table below. |
| exabyteId      | Identifier in Bank Entity Collection | In the case where the entity under consideration is of a "Bankable" entity type, its identifier within the corresponding [Bank Entity Collection](bank.md) is provided by this keyword, distinct from the above mentioned Account-owned collection identifier. |
| hash |  Bank Mapping Function Identifier   |  The entity item within the Bank collection is further labelled by this string keyword, generated by the [Bank Mapping Function](bank.md) at the moment of the entity item addition to the Bank collection.   |
| schemaVersion |  Version of the Exabyte Data Convention  | The version of the [Exabyte Data Convention](/data/convention/overview.md), which was employed at the moment of the creation of the entity's structured representation, is recorded under this keyword.  |
| createdAt / updatedAt  | Date and Time Information  | Information about the date and time at which the entity was first created in the Account-owned collection, and at which is was last edited by a user, is contained in these two keywords respectively.  |
| tags | Descriptive Metadata  | See the dedicated section below for further explanations. |

## Owner/Creator

| Keyword    |  Short Description      | Details        | 
| :-------- |:----------- |:------------- |
| "_id" | Identifier in Platform    |  Each user and associated Account(s) contained in our platform has a corresponding unique Identifier code  |
| "slug" | Name of User/Account | The human-readable name of the Account which owns the entity under consideration, or of the user who created the entity originally. |
| "cls"  | User/Account distinction    | Draws the distinction between [Accounts](/accounts/overview.md) and [Users](/accounts/users.md). The Owner of an entity is always an Account, whereas the entity's creator is one of the Account's constituent users |


# Metadata

Metadata refers to data (or information) that in turn provides information about other data. In the context of our platform, Metadata is used primarily to assist the user in [searching](actions/search.md) through the Entity collections. For this purpose, we supplement collection entries with additional descriptive textual information, such as user-defined tags.

The above example of JSON representation shows how tags are stored within structured data, under the final "tags" keyword.

Metadata can be added to an entity item in one or more of the following forms: 

## Description

In some cases, the user can add a general description of the entity's features and applications for reference purposes, which can be entered in plain text or using the Markdown language [[2](#links)].

## Tags

The user can add descriptive tags to the entity in order to retrieve it more easily when searches are performed. Tags take the form of separate keyword strings, that can each contain one or multiple words. They can be inserted according to the [following instructions](actions/metadata.md).

## Metadata for surfaces / slabs

A specific kind of metadata is used to mark slab / surface materials. Such metadata is stored in the entity on its creation and can, for example, be used for surface energy calculations. This is explained further in the [corresponding documentation section](/materials-designer/header-menu/advanced/surface-slab/#structural-metadata).

# Slug Representation

It is often necessary to convert keyword strings within structured data to a more machine-friendly format. Examples include strings containing whitespaces or special characters in them. 

We make use of the "Slug" representation for converting such strings into machine-readable versions. This involves for example replacing whitespaces with dashes, and other similar conventions [[3](#links)].
