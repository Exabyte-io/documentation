# Structured Data

We store each item in the Entity Collections in the form of **structured data** in JSON format [[1](#links)]. The user is referred to the corresponding [section of the documentation](/data/convention/structured.md) for the explanation of the concept of structured data in the context of our platform.

# Example JSON representation

The following is an example of the JSON representation of an entity, where only the general keywords applicable to all entity types are preserved. 

The reader is referred to the entity-specific documentation pages for a more detailed explanation about the kind of structured data that might pertain specifically to [Materials](/materials/data.md), [Workflows](/workflows/data/data.md) and [Jobs](/jobs/data.md) respectively. 

```json
{
    "_id":"Xgtqqsr7btyCijDKe",
    "name":"Silicon FCC",
    "owner":{
        "_id":"z9zo7LmZ4hDvJKHK8",
        "slug":"demo",
        "cls":"Account"
    },
    "creator":{
        "_id":"2hFARLuq44zp3JWC9",
        "slug":"demo",
        "cls":"User"

# Explanation of Keywords

## Top-level Keywords

| Keyword    |  Short Description      | Details        | 
| :-------- |:----------- |:------------- |
| "_id" | Identifier in Account-owned Entity Collection    | To each entity contained in an Account-owned collection, a unique Collection Identifier code is attributed by our platform. |
| "name" | Name of Entity | Entity's human-readable name in Account-owned Collection. |
| "owner" and "creator" | Entity Owner and Creator | Further information about both the Account [owning](ownership.md) the entity, and about the user who created it in the first place, is also contained in the entity's structured representation as two separate nested JSON **Objects**. These are described separately in the other table below. |
| "exabyteId"      | Identifier in Bank Entity Collection | In the case where the entity under consideration is of a "Bankable" entity type, its identifier within the corresponding [Bank Entity Collection](bank.md) is provided by this keyword, distinct from the above mentioned Account-owned collection identifier. |
| "hash" |  Bank Mapping Function Identifier   |  The entity item within the Bank collection is further labelled by this string keyword, generated by the [Bank Mapping Function](bank.md) at the moment of the entity item addition to the Bank collection.   |
| "schemaVersion" |  Version of the Exabyte Data Convention  | The version of the [Exabyte Data Convention](/data/convention/overview.md), which was employed at the moment of the creation of the entity's structured representation, is recorded under this keyword.  |
| "createdAt" and "updatedAt"  | Date and Time Information  | Information about the date and time at which the entity was first created in the Account-owned collection, and at which is was last edited by a user, is contained in these two keywords respectively.  |
| "tags" | Descriptive Metadata  | See the dedicated section below for further explanations. |

## Owner/Creator

| Keyword    |  Short Description      | Details        | 
| :-------- |:----------- |:------------- |
| "_id" | Identifier in Platform    | To each user and associated Account(s) contained in our platform corresponds a unique Identifier code  |
| "slug" | Name of User/Account | The human-readable name of the Account which owns the entity under consideration, or of the user who created the entity originally. |
| "cls"  | User/Account distinction    | Draws the distinction between [Accounts](/accounts/overview.md) and [Users](/accounts/users.md). The Owner of an entity is always an Account, whereas the entity's creator is one of the Account's constituent users |


# Metadata

Metadata refers to data (or information) that in turn provides information about other data. In the context of our platform, Metadata is used primarily to assist the user in searching through the  Entity collections. 

For this purpose, we supplement collection entries with additional descriptive textual information, such as user-defined tags, which can be inserted according to the [following instructions](actions/metadata.md).

The above example of JSON representation offers an indication of how tags are stored within structured data, under the final "tags" keyword.
