# Entity Viewer Interface

By [opening](../actions/open-edit.md) any item listed under the Entity Items List of the [Explorer Interface](explorer.md), it is possible for the user to inspect its contents under the "Viewer" interface corresponding to that particular entity type.

# Relation to [Designer](designer.md) 

We often reuse the [Designer Interface](designer.md) as a Viewer component for the equivalent entity type. The two have similar external appearance, but differ in the functionality that they provide in terms of the possibility to edit the entity item under consideration. Thus, some of the components of Designer can be omitted or disabled when it is reused as a Viewer. Minor adjustments to the entity may still be possible in Viewer depending on the entity type.

Documentation pages presenting the various entity-specific aspects of the Viewer Interface are available for [Materials](/materials/ui/viewer.md), [Workflows](/workflows/ui/viewer.md) and [Jobs](/jobs/ui/viewer.md) respectively.
