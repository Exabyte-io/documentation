# Entity Viewer

"Viewer" allows the user to inspect the content of an [Entity](../overview.md) listed under the [Explorer Interface](explorer.md) its contents [Opening](../actions/open-edit.md).

# Relation to [Designer](designer.md) 

We often reuse the [Designer Interface](designer.md) as a Viewer component for the equivalent entity type. The two have similar external appearance, but differ in the functionality that they provide in terms of the possibility to edit the entity. Some of the components of Designer can be omitted or disabled when it is reused as a Viewer. Minor adjustments to the entity may still be possible in Viewer, depending on the entity type. 

# Links

Specialized documentation pages on the Viewer are available for [Materials](/materials-designer/overview.md), [Workflows](/workflow-designer/general-overview.md) and [Jobs](/jobs-designer/overview.md) respectively.
