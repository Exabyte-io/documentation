# Common User Interface Components

There are some aspects of the general User Interface of our platform which are shared between entities of all different [types](../overview.md). In particular, there are three such common interface components which are worth pointing out: Entity Explorer, Designer and Viewer.

# Access Points

The image below highlights the **access points**, within the broader [Account Profile](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page, to the three components described below:

# 1. Entity Explorer

The "Explorer" interface offers a convenient way of visualizing graphically the contents of the various [Account-owned Entity Collections](/accounts/collections.md) under our platform, and to perform [actions](../actions/overview.md) upon such collection items. Everything that concerns this common component of the user interface is explained in this [page](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).

The Explorer interface for each entity type can be accessed through a dedicated [tab within the user interface](/ui/tabs-navigator.md), as depicted in the image above.

# 2. Entity Designer

To create any type of new entity, the corresponding "Designer" interface needs to be consulted and operated. This particular interface component is documented [here](/entities-general/ui/designer.md).

# 3. Entity Viewer

When an existing entity needs to be inspected to verify its contents, without the need to apply any changes to its current form, then it may be opened from the entity collection. This allows the entity to be viewed under the corresponding "Viewer" component of the user interface, documented [here](viewer.md).
