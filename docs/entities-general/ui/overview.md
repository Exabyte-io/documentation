# Common User Interface Components

Some components are shared between entities of different [types](../overview.md). Three of them are worth pointing out: Entity Explorer, Designer and Viewer.

# Access Points

The image below highlights their **access points**, within the [Account Profile](/accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page.

# 1. Explorer

The "Explorer" affords for the visualization of [Account-owned Entity Collections](/accounts/collections.md). It can also be used to perform [actions](../actions/overview.md) upon the items that they contain.  This component is described in the [following page](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md).

The Explorer for each entity type can be accessed through the corresponding [tab](/ui/tabs-navigator.md), as depicted in the image above.

# 2. Designer

Creation of new entities is done via the corresponding "Designer", documented [here](/entities-general/ui/designer.md).

# 3. Viewer

The user can inspect existing entities by [opening them](../actions/open-edit.md) from the corresponding collection. Inspection is done under the "Viewer" component, documented [here](viewer.md).
