# Common Components

Some User Interface components are shared between entities of different [types](../overview.md): Entity Explorer, Designer and Viewer.

## [Access Points](../../accounts/ui/profile-page.md)

The image below highlights their **access points** (or click triggers), within the [Account Profile](../../accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page.

## [1. Explorer](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md)

The "Explorer" affords for the visualization of the [Entity Collections](../../accounts/collections.md). It can also be used to perform [actions](../actions/overview.md) upon the items that they contain. This component is described in the [following page](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md).

Explorer for each entity type can be accessed through the corresponding [tab](../../ui/specific/tabs-navigator.md), as depicted in the image above.

## [2. Designer](../../entities-general/ui/designer.md)

Creation of new entities is done via the corresponding "Designer", documented [here](../../entities-general/ui/designer.md).

## [3. Viewer](viewer.md)

The user can inspect existing entities by [opening them](../actions/open-edit.md) under the "Viewer" component, documented [here](viewer.md).
