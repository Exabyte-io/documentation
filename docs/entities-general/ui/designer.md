# Entity Designer Interface

The Designer component of the user interface allows the user to Edit existing entities, or Design new ones from scratch. This latter action is normally performed via the ["Create"](../actions/create.md) general standard procedure for new entities.

Documentation pages presenting the various entity-specific aspects of the Designer Interface are available for [Materials](/materials-designer/overview.md), [Workflows](/workflow-designer/general-overview.md) and [Jobs](/jobs-designer/overview.md) respectively.
