# Entity Designer Interface

The "Designer" component of the user interface allows the user to edit existing entities, or design new ones from scratch. This latter action is normally performed via the ["Create"](../actions/create.md) button.

Specialized documentation pages on the Designer are available for [Materials](/materials-designer/overview.md), [Workflows](/workflow-designer/general-overview.md) and [Jobs](/jobs-designer/overview.md) respectively.
