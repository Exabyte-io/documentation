# Explorer Interface

The Explorer Interface within the wider User Interface is composed of the following subcomponents: 

## Entity List

The  Entity List component of the Explorer interface represents a list, or Table, and allows users to view and execute actions on multiple Entities at once. This component is illustrated below (named "General Items List") for the example entity case of Materials:

## Displayed Properties Dropdown

The table of properties or physical quantities appearing to the right of each entity entry can be customized through the top three-dotted drop-down menu of the Explorer Interface. Next to this menu button, the possibility to scroll the table of displayed properties horizontally is also offered, under the button labelled with a pair of triangular brackets which toggles such a horizontal scroll functionality.   

The precise location of both the dropdown and horizontal scroll toggle buttons, within the wider Explorer interface, is pin-pointed in the highlighted section on the image below:

## Actions Toolbar

Actions Toolbar allows users to execute actions on multiple Entities at once. Entities can be selected using the corresponding checkboxes on each entry line.

## Actions Dropdown

The actions Dropdown allows one to execute the actions on a specific entry. The set of allowed actions is filtered per each entry according to its type and permissions.

## Visuals

The location of both the toolbar and dropdown menus containing the action buttons within the Explorer interface is further clarified in the panels emphasized in the image below:
