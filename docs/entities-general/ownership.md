# Account Ownership of Entities 

Every entity contained within the Exabyte platform has an **Owning Account**, more commonly referred to as the **Owner** of that entity. The Owner initially defaults to the Account under which that entity was **created**, which can be of both [personal or Organizational type](/accounts/overview.md). 

When entities of each [type](overview.md) are treated collectively, we refer to them as **Account-owned Entity Collections**, which are the object of a [separate discussion](/accounts/collections.md)).

It is important to emphasize that the concept of Entity Ownership applies to the Accounts themselves, Organizational or personal as they may be, and not to any of its  users/members.


# Transmission of Entity Ownership

Following its creation, an entity item may circulate between accounts within the network of our platform, by for example being shared or copied. This makes the traceability of its ownership important to define:

## Propagation under Entity Sharing

When an entity is [shared](/collaboration/sharing/ui.md) with another account, or it is made publicly available to all users of the platform or to the external internet, its ownership remains **unaltered**: the entity remains owned by the Account under which it was created, no matter how many times it is shared.

## Separation under Entity Copying

When an entity is [copied](/entities-general/actions/clone.md) by the user of a certain Account "X", a new distinct entry will be created under the corresponding Account-owned entity collection, with exactly the same contents as the original entity item. 

The ownership of this new cloned item will as a result belong to the Account "X", and not to the Account which contained the original item, despite both items holding the same entity-related contents.

## Transfer: not Available

The Ownership of an entity needs not to be changed normally. However, should the reader ever encounter the necessity  to perform such an action, he is advised to proceed under the assistance of our [Support Service](/ui/universal/support.md), since this feature is not currently being offered by default on our platform.
