# Create New Sets

Starting from either the Materials or Jobs pages, [Sets](../sets.md) can be created as new entries in the account-owned collection by clicking on the `Create Set` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-folder-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions toolbar](overview.md#actions-toolbar).  The user will then be presented with the following highlighted dialog, which allows the name of the new set to be defined in the central text field:

<img src="/images/create-set-name.png" > 

Once the "Submit" button is pressed, the new Set will appear among the list of entries in the corresponding account-owned collection. 


# Navigate Sets

To navigate up the Sets directory structure by one level each time, the user should click on the top entry (labelled with two horizontal dots) from within a Set items list, in an analogous way to the symbolism of Unix-based command-line interfaces. 

# Animation

In the animation below, we demonstrate an example of creation of a new empty Set which we decide to call "Test", followed by the navigation inside of it and then up again to the parent level of the original list of Materials:

# Delete Sets

The [standard procedure](actions/delete.md) for deleting items from an account-owned collection of entities can be followed with regards to Sets also.
