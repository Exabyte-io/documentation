# Create New Sets

[Sets](../sets.md) can be created in the account-owned [collections](../../accounts/collections.md) of Materials or Jobs by clicking `Create Set` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-folder-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).  

The user is presented with the following highlighted dialog, under which the name of the new set can be entered in the text field:

<img src="/images/entities-general/create-set-name.png" > 

Once "Submit" button is pressed, the new Set appears among the entries in the account-owned collection. 

## Navigation

In order to navigate up the Sets directory structure by one level, the user should click on the top entry (labelled with two horizontal dots) from within the Set's items list. This symbolism is analogous to Unix-based command-line interface. 

## Animation

In the animation below, we demonstrate how to create a new empty Set called "Test". We then navigate inside of it and up again to the original level.

## Delete Sets

The [standard procedure](delete.md) for deleting items from an account-owned collection can be followed with regards to Sets also.
