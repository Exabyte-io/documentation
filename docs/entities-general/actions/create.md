# Create New Entities

Creation of a new entity in the relevant Account-owned collection can be initiated through "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o zmdi-hc-border"></i>, located in the actions toolbar of the [Explorer Interface](../ui/explorer.md#action-related-components). This leads the user to the corresponding  [Entity Designer](../ui/designer.md) for conceiving a new entity from scratch. 

# Animation 

In the example animation below, we take workflows as our case study. We demonstrate how to enter the Workflow Designer starting from the account-owned collection.
