# Create New Entities

The creation of new entities in the corresponding Account-owned Collection can typically be performed through the "Create" button <i class="zmdi zmdi-plus-circle-o zmdi-hc-border"></i> located under the top-right [Actions Toolbar of the Explorer Interface](../ui/explorer.md) for that entity type.

Clicking on this "Create" button will lead the user to the corresponding  [Entity Designer Interface](../ui/designer.md) for designing and conceiving a new entity of that particular type from scratch.
