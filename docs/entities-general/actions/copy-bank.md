# Import Entities from Bank

In order to import Materials or Workflows from their respective Banks into the Account-owned collection, the following general procedure should be followed.

# Open Bank Page 

The user should first click the corresponding `Bank` option in the [left-hand Sidebar](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md). The choice between navigating to either of the Materials or Workflows Banks is offered. The user is presented with a comprehensive list of centrally-stored Workflows or Materials, depending on the selected option.

# Search for Entity

The list of banked entities can be searched with the help of the [search text bar](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top of the Bank page.

# Copy to Account Collection

Importing entities from the Bank into the Account collection is achieved by first selecting the desired entries. This is done by ticking their respective left-hand checkboxes. The `Copy` <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> button should finally be clicked in the top-right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).

Entity-specific explanations of the above procedure are available for [Materials](/materials/bank.md) and [Workflows](/workflows/bank.md) respectively.
