# Import Entities from Bank

In order to import entities of type "Material" or "Workflow" from their respective Bank repositories into the corresponding account-owned collection, the following general procedure should be followed:

# Open Bank Page 

The user should first click on the corresponding `Bank` option in the [left-hand sidebar menu](/ui/universal/left-sidebar.md) of the User Interface. After the first click, the choice between navigating to either of the Materials or Workflows Banks is offered to the user. The user will be presented with a comprehensive list of centrally-stored Workflows or Materials, depending on the selected option.

# Search for Entity

The list of banked entities can be conveniently searched through with the help of the [search text bar](/entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top of the Bank page.

# Copy to Account Collection

To import entities from the Bank into the user's Account-owned collection, the user should first select the desired entry items by ticking their respective left-hand checkboxes, and then click on `Copy` <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right taskbar of the Bank page.
