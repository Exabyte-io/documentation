# Open / View Entity

The user might wish at some point to view or adjust an existing entity, for example to [edit its name](name.md) or change the associated [metadata](metadata.md). The `Open` action makes it possible.

# Edit Entity

The user can choose an entity item listed in its collection page, and can then open it under the corresponding [Viewer](../ui/viewer.md) interface to inspect it or bring changes to it. 

# How to Open an Entity

Two equivalent approaches can be adopted to open an entity: either the user can directly click the name of the entity in the [Explorer list](../ui/explorer.md), or use the `Open` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-eye zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the actions [drop-down menu](../ui/explorer.md#action-related-components).

# Animation

In the animation below we demonstrate both ways of opening a workflow from the account-owned collection. We then inspect it under the Workflow Viewer.
