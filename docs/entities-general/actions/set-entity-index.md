# Set Entity Index

In order to change the order of entities inside an **ordered** set, [navigate](open-edit.md) to the set first and then use `Set Index` option in the [actions drop-down menu](../ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown). The user is presented with the following dialog to set a new index.

![Set Index](../../images/entities-general/set-entity-index.png "Set Index")

If the new index is already assigned to another entity in the set, the indices will be swapped.
