# Clone / copy entities

The cloning (or copying) of one or more entity items, present in an account-owned collection, into a new distinct entry can be achieved as follows.

1. [select](select.md) one or multiple entities,
2. click `Copy` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) at the top of the collection list.
 
Alternatively, cloning operation can be performed through `Copy` option under the [actions drop-down menu](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) <i class="zmdi zmdi-more-vert zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the right-end of the entry that needs to be copied.

## Cloned Entry

Once the cloning is finished, a new separate entry with exactly the same content as the original is generated at the top of the collection list (as the list items are sorted by their creation date by default). The initial name of this new clone entity always defaults to the original name with the string "(clone)" appended to it. 

## Animation

We demonstrate how cloning works in an example animation below: we clone a newly-created workflow (labelled "Empty Workflow") into a new distinct entry shown directly above it in the collection.
