# Clone / copy entities

The cloning (or copying) of one or more entity items present in an account-owned collection into a new distinct entry can be achieved as follows: 

1. select one or multiple entity entries by ticking their corresponding checkboxes.
2. click the `Copy` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the actions toolbar at the top of the collection list.
 
Alternatively, this cloning operation can be achieved directly through the `Copy` option action under the three-dotted actions drop-down menu <i class="zmdi zmdi-more-vert zmdi-hc-border"></i> at the right-end of the entity entry line that needs to be copied.

# Cloned Entry

Once the copying is finished, a new separate entry with exactly the same content as the original will be generated and included in the collection list at the top (as the items in the list are sorted by the creation date by default). The initial name of this new clone entity always defaults to the original name with the string "(clone)" appended to it. 

# Animation

We demonstrate how cloning works in an example animation below, where we clone a newly-created workflow (labelled "Empty Workflow") into a new distinct entry shown directly above it in the account-owned workflows list:
