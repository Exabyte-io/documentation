# Advanced Entity Search

 In order to perform a comprehensive search, and filter the Entities in the corresponding [collection](/accounts/collections.md), the Advanced Search feature can be used.. The explanation contained in this page is relevant to [Materials](/materials/overview.md). Advanced Search functionality is also available is for [Account Charges](/accounts/ui/charges-payments.md).

# Activate Advanced Search

Click on the `Advanced Search` tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> offered in the top-right actions toolbar of the [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#action-related-components) in order to activate the functionality and view the search query builder.

# Query Builder

Advanced search functionality is implemented through a flexible "Query Builder": an interface that allows to construct arbitrary queries using logical rules and the supported fields. The search statements are structured in the form of "Groups", each containing a series of "Rules". Both Groups and Rules can be added to the overall logical flow with the help of the `+ Rule` and `+ Group` buttons, or deleted using the `-` button. The Rules inside each Group, and the Groups themselves, can be logically combined together through the "AND/OR" logical operators.

# Rules

Each Rule is composed of three successive entries. First, an entity-related property should be selected from the initial drop-down menu. Secondly, a logical operator should be chosen from the available list in the central drop-down menu. Finally, a search string or numerical value corresponding to the sought property can be entered in the third and final text field. 

# Execute Query

Once all the logical statements and operators have been inserted as part of the desired overall flow, the resulting advanced search can be executed by clicking `Search`. The corresponding search results are then displayed. 

# Reset

The entire logical flow can be reset using `Reset` button.

# Examples

Refer to [Materials-](/materials/actions/advanced-search.md) and [Charges-](/accounts/accounting/charges-advanced-search.md) specific pages to see how advanced search can be performed.
