# Advanced Entity Search

!!!warning "Note: restricted applicability"
    The explanation contained in this page is only relevant for Materials, since the "Advanced Search" functionality is not currently offered for either Workflows or Jobs. An additional context where Advanced Search functionality is available is in reviewing [Account Charges](/accounts/ui/charges-payments.md).

In order to perform a comprehensive search, and filter the entries in the relevant collection available for an account, the Advanced Search feature can be used.

# Activate Advanced Search

Click on the `Advanced Search` tool <i class="zmdi zmdi-search-for zmdi-hc-border"></i> offered in the top-right actions toolbar of the [Explorer Interface](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#action-related-components) in order to activate the functionality and view the search query builder.

# Query Builder

Advanced search functionality is implemented through a flexible "Query Builder": an interface that allows users to construct arbitrary queries using logical rules and the supported fields. The search statements are structured in the form of "Groups", each containing a series of "Rules". Both Groups and Rules can be added to the overall logical flow with the help of the `+ Rule` and `+ Group` buttons, or deleted using the `-` button. The Rules inside each Group, and the Groups themselves, can be logically combined together through the "AND/OR" logical operators.

# Rules

Each Rule is composed of three successive entries. An entity-related property has firstly to be selected from the initial drop-down menu. Secondly, a logical operator has to be chosen from the available list in the central drop-down menu. Finally, a  search string or numerical value corresponding to the sought property can be entered in the third and final text field. 

# Execute Query

Once all the logical statements and operators have been inserted as part of the desired overall flow, the resulting advanced search can be executed by clicking the `Search` button, and the corresponding search results will then be displayed. Alternatively, the entire logical flow can be reverted to its original basic appearance with the neighbouring `Reset` button.
