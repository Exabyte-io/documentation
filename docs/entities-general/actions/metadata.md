# Edit Description

We demonstrate in the animation below how to add an example description to a Job inspected in [Viewer](/jobs/ui/viewer.md). After opening the relevant dialog, we enter a series of headers in the Markdown syntax [[1](#links)] and then add a link to a webpage. As demonstrated in the animation the editor is implemented using the "what you see is what you get" approach [[2](#links)].

# Edit Tags

In order to edit Tags, modify the content in the relevant text field pressing "Enter" key after each word or phrase. The corresponding tag is consequently included on the same line, with the option to delete it made available to its right through the "X" icon button. 

The aforementioned process is demonstrated in the animation below.
