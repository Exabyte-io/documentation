# Adding Metadata to Entities

Metadata can be added to an entity item in one or more of the following forms: 

# Description

In some cases, the user can add a general description of the entity's features and applications for reference purposes, which can be entered in plain text or using the Markdown language [[1](#links)].

![Example Description](/images/example-description.png "Example Description")

# Tags

The user can add descriptive tags to the Entity in order to further retrieve the item when searches are performed. Tags take the form of separate keyword strings (sentences), that can each contain one or multiple words. Tags can be entered in the text field one at a time, pressing the "Enter" key afterwards. The corresponding tag badge will be included on the same line, with the option to delete it made available to its right through a click on the "X" symbol. This is demonstrated in the animation below:

# Metadata for surfaces / slabs

A specific kind of metadata is used to mark slab / surface materials. Such metadata is stored in the Entity on its creation and can is used for surface energy calculations, for example. This is explained further in the [corresponding documentation section](/materials-designer/header-menu/advanced/surface-slab/#structural-metadata).
