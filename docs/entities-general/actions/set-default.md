# Changing Default Entity

In order to change the default item, use `Set default` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-star-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions drop-down menu](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown). 

> NOTE: an entity cannot be deleted from an account-owned collection for as long as it is set as the default one. Only one entity at a time can be set as default in the context of a particular collection.

## Animation

If we take workflows as our case study, then a new default entry can be chosen as demonstrated in the animation below.
