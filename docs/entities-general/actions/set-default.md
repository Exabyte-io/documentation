# Default Entities

Materials and Workflows have a "default" item in their respective collection. The default material, for example, is used to pre-configure the job and workflow designer. The workflow templating context may adjust depending on the material, and users can tune the adjustments by changing the default material. Similarly, users can set the most frequently used workflow as default in order to avoid changing it during the job creation.

# Changing Default

In order to change the default item out of a collection of entities, use the `Set default` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-star-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the right-end [actions drop-down menu](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown), for the desired entry to be set as default. The user can recognize this choice as being the default entity for future operations by the check-mark assigned to it under the "Default" column of the collection Explorer interface. 

> NOTE: an entity item cannot be deleted from an account-owned collection for as long as it is set to be the default one. Only one entity at a time can be set as default in the context of a particular collection. 

# Animation

If we take workflows as our case study, then a new default entry can be chosen as demonstrated in the animation below:
