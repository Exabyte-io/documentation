# Default Entities

Material and Workflow entities have a "default" property associated with itself. The default material, for-example, is used to pre-configure the job and workflow designer. The workflow templating context may adjust depending on the material, and users can tune the adjustments by changing the default material. Similarly, users can set the most frequently used workflow as default in order to avoid changing it during the job creation. The Default entry has a check-mark assigned to it under the "Default" column in the entity list.

# Changing Default Entity

In order to change the default item out of a collection of entity items, use the `Set default` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-star-outline zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the drop-down menu at the right-end of the entry line for the desired entry to be set as default. The user will recognize this choice as being the default entity for future operations by the check-mark assigned to it under the "Default" column of the collection interface. 

> NOTE: an entity item cannot be deleted from an account-owned collection for as long as it is set to be the default one. Only one entity at a time can be set as default in the context of a particular collection. 

# Animation

If we take workflows as our entity case study, then the setting of a new default entry in the account-owned workflows collection interface is performed as demonstrated in the animation below:
