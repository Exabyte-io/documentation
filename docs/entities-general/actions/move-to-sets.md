# Move Entity Items to Sets

Any item from an account-owned collection of entities (including other Sets as well) can be moved into a previously-created [Set](../sets.md) by first selecting the item through its left-hand checkbox, and then clicking on the `Move to Set` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-square-right zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right actions [toolbar](overview.md#actions-toolbar). 

The user will at this point be presented with the following dialog, through which the destination Set can be searched by its name in the central text field. As new characters are entered in this search bar, suggestions are offered in real time for convenience in the drop-down menu appearing directly below it.

The item transfer operation is completed once the "Submit" button is pressed, at which point the entity item will no longer be present at its original location but rather inside the final destination Set. 

# Animation

In the animation below, we show how a Material entity item consisting in silicon can be moved into the Set labelled "Test", which is in fact in this particular case the only Set present in our Materials collection and therefore appears immediately as a suggestion in the dialog's drop-down menu. We then navigate inside the Set to confirm the presence of this newly transferred element:
