# Move Entities to Sets

Items in the account-owned collection of entities (including other Sets) can be moved into a [Set](../sets.md) by first selecting the item through its left-hand checkbox, and then clicking `Move to Set` <i class="zmdi zmdi-square-right zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the top-right [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar). 

The user is presented with the following dialog. Here, the destination Set can be searched by its name in the central text field. As new characters are entered, suggestions are offered in real time in the drop-down menu appearing directly below.

The transfer operation is completed once the "Submit" button is pressed. At this point the entity item is no longer present at its original location, but rather inside the  destination Set. 

# Animation

In the animation below, we show how a silicon material sample can be moved into the Set labelled "Test". In this case, this is the only Set present in our Materials collection, and therefore appears immediately as a suggestion in the dialog's drop-down menu. We then navigate inside the Set to confirm the presence of this newly transferred element.
