# Modify Name of Entity

Changing the name of an entity is achieved by first [opening](open-edit.md) it. The name can then be edited at the top of the corresponding [Viewer](../ui/viewer.md) interface.  

In the animation below, we show an example of how to change the name of a workflow within the [Workflow Viewer](../../workflows/ui/viewer.md).
