# Deleting Entities

In order to delete an entry from an entity collection, first [select](select.md) it, and then press `Delete` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-delete zmdi-hc-border"></i> in the [actions toolbar](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar) at the top-right corner of the collection page.

Alternatively, the user can directly delete each entry from the collection through the [actions drop-down menu](/entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) located at the right-end of each entry line.

# Animation

We demonstrate both approaches towards deleting an Entity in the animation below, where we delete two example instances of empty workflows in turn.
