# Deleting Entities

## Option 1

In order to delete an entry item from a collection list of entities, first select it by ticking its corresponding left-hand checkbox, and then press on the `Delete` button <i class="zmdi zmdi-delete zmdi-hc-border"></i> located in the actions toolbar at the top-right corner of the collection page. 

## Option 2

Alternatively, the user can directly delete each entry from the collection through the drop-down menu button located at the end of each entry line.

# Animation

We demonstrate both approaches towards deleting an Entity in the animation below, where we subsequently delete two example instances of empty workflows:
