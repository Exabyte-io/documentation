# Change Entity Set Type

In order to change the type of a set, use `Change Type` option in the [actions drop-down menu](../ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown). The user is presented with the following dialog to select the type.

![Change Set Type](../../images/entities-general/change-set-type.png "Change Set Type")

The entities inside the set are ordered descendingly by their creation time when the type of a set is changed to **ordered**.

## Animation

In the animation below, we show how to change the type of a set labelled "Test" to **ordered**. We then navigate inside the set to confirm the order of entities:
