## Read Permission

To allow the share public to simply visualize the contents of the entity, without granting them the opportunity to bring about changes to this entity or execute any of its computational tasks, the "Read" <i class="zmdi zmdi-menu zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission option should be chosen and applied.

## Execute Permission

The "Execute" <i class="zmdi zmdi-play zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission on the other hand gives the members of the share public the possibility to execute the computational tasks associated with the entity under consideration.

## Edit Permission

The "Edit" <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission finally grants other users the possibility to make modifications to the entity being shared with them.
