# Entity permissions

Permissions are sets of **rules** which define which types of actions are **allowed** to be performed on an entity by an account. Examples of actions that are regulated by permissions include inspection, manipulation and/or modification of the entity by the various Accounts in our platform.

The Account which created (and which therefore [owns](ownership.md)) an entity is always automatically granted full permissions to it, among the list of permission types outlined in the remainder of the present documentation page:

# Types of Permissions

The following set of permission types are offered on our platform: 

## Read Permission

To allow other Accounts to simply visualize the contents of the entity under consideration, without granting them the opportunity to bring about changes to it or execute any of its computational tasks, the "Read" <i class="zmdi zmdi-menu zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission option should be chosen and applied.

## Execute Permission

The "Execute" <i class="zmdi zmdi-play zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission, on the other hand, gives Accounts the possibility to execute the computational tasks associated with the  entity upon which the permission is being applied.

## Edit Permission

The "Edit" <i class="zmdi zmdi-edit zmdi-hc-border"></i> permission grants the possibility to make modifications to the entity.

## Comment Permission

Finally, the "Comment" permission allows Accounts to write comments under the given entity, in a format and spirit similar to popular social network platforms.

!!!note "Note: feature not implemented yet"
    The last "Comment" feature and associated permission have not been implemented on our platform yet.

# Relevance to Entity Sharing and Organizations

The concept of permissions is particularly important and resourceful in the context of [entity sharing](/collaboration/sharing/ui.md) between accounts, and in the case of [assignment of entities]((/collaboration/actions/team/add-remove-entity.md)) to [Teams](/collaboration/organizations/teams.md) within the spectrum of Organization-related [actions](/collaboration/actions/organization/overview.md).

!!!note  "Note: analogy with Google Drive functionality"
    Similarly to [Access Levels](/collaboration/sharing/access-levels.md), the permission types included on our platform mirror the functionality of Google Drive files and folders  closely [[1](#links)].
