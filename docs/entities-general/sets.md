# Entity Sets

Some Entities (Materials and Jobs) can each be grouped together into "Sets" to organize them better. Sets therefore play a similar same role as **folders** in an operating system environment, for example.

# Inspect Contents
 
Following the [creation](actions/create-sets.md) of a new Set, the user can [open it](actions/open-edit.md) to inspect its contents. 

# Move Contents

Entities (and other Sets as well) can be moved to Sets following [these instructions](actions/move-to-sets.md).

# Nested Structure

New sub-sets can be created inside a parent Set. Iterating this operation results in a nested directory structure.
