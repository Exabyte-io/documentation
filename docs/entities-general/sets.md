# Sets of entities

Materials and Jobs (but not Workflows) can each be grouped together into "Sets" for convenience and organizational purposes, based on what the user deems are their similarities. In this respect, Sets play very much the same role as folders in a operating system desktop environment. 
 
Following the [creation](actions/create-sets.md) of a new Set, the user can click on its entry among the Account-owned Entity Collection to [open it](actions/open-edit.md) and inspect its contents at any time. 

Entities (and other Sets as well) can be moved to Sets following [these instructions](actions/move-to-sets.md).

# Nested Sets Structure

New sub-sets can furthermore be created inside existing Sets as many times as the user wishes, to produce a resulting nested directory structure.
