# Types of Entities

The user interface of the platform contains three main distinct classes of **Entities**, each recognizable by its unique symbol illustrated next to each entry in the list below:

| Entity    |  Icon      | Details        | 
| :-------- |:----------- |:------------- |
| Materials | <i class="zmdi zmdi-widgets"></i>    | Hold information about individual materials |
| Workflows | <i class="zmdi zmdi-dot-circle"></i> | Contain logical set of computational operations, applicable to multiple materials |
| Jobs      | <i class="zmdi zmdi-file"></i> | Represent computational tasks on a particular material-workflow combination to produce the corresponding properties and output files as results |

Each one of the above has a dedicated tab within the user interface, as depicted in the image below:

# Common Entity Actions

Please refer to [this page](/entities-general/actions/overview.md) for an introduction to actions which pertain to all different entity types.

# Sets

Jobs and Materials (but not Workflows) can collectively be grouped together under folders, or "Sets", as explained [here](actions/sets.md).

# Bank

Please refer to [this page](bank.md) for an introduction to the "Bank" concept.

# Common User Interface Components

There are interface components, and some of their respective sub-components, which are common to all entity types, and these include the following:
