# Exabyte.io Documentation

[Exabyte.io](https://exabyte.io/) is a computational platform for the development of new materials and chemicals. The present documentation explains how the [platform](https://platform.exabyte.io/) works in details. Currently deployed version of the documentation is available at [this link](http://docs.exabyte.io).

## Setup

For a quick installation:

1. Install dependencies: python 2.7, `pip`, [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/), git, [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

2. Clone this repository: 

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Exabyte-io/documentation.git
    ```

3. Setup virtual environment

    ```bash
    cd documentation
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Init git submodules:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --recursive --init
    ```

5. (Optional) Set the documentation directory, if plan to use other languages than English:

    ```bash
    export DOCS_dir="lang/ja/docs"
    ```

6. Start mkdocs server (after sourcing virtual environment):

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

You should have the documentation up and running at `http://localhost:8000`

## Development

[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started) is used to convert Markdown files (*.md) into static html and [is configured](mkdocs.yml) to use [Mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

### Formatting Styles

#### Headers

Write the main header (title) of the page as the first line, using top-level markdown notation (`#`). After adopting ["Material"](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) mkdocs theme, the Table of contents (on the right, containing the current page structure) is not operational when more than one top-level header is present (h1). Therefore, we shall limit each and every page to only use **one** top-level header, and all the rest should be entered as sub-headers.
 
All other sub-headers contained throughout the remainder of the page should then be entered as second, third or even fourth degree headers, like in the following example:

```text
# Main Header (only one allowed, to be put in first line of page)
## Second-degree Sub-header
### Third-degree Sub-Header
#### Fourth-degree Sub-header
```

#### New Lines

Leave a newline after the heading elements:

```text
## Job

You can create a new job by clicking the appropriate icon.
```

#### Empty Spaces

Leave ONLY one empty line at the bottom of the page, and between paragraphs. Minimize the presence of unnecessary empty spaces within the main text of the page.

Leave more than one empty line (2-3) when "coming back" to higher-level header from nested level, as below:

```text
## Job

...

### Job Parameters

...

#### Job Sub-parameters

...


## Workflow

...
```

#### Admonition Styles

There are multiple [admonition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/) classes available in MKDocs: tip (green), warning (orange), error (red), note (blue), and many others. To insert them in documentation pages, enter them with the following style:

```text
!!!tip "Unused credits"
    All unused credits automatically roll over into the next validity period.
```

is rendered into:

!!!tip "Unused credits"
    All unused credits automatically roll over into the next validity period.

#### Expandable Sections

Expandable section can be added using:

```text
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>**INCAR**</summary>
    ```
    ALGO = Normal
    EDIFF = 0.0001
    ...
    ```
</details>
```

is rendered into:

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>**INCAR**</summary>
    ```
    ALGO = Normal<br>
    EDIFF = 0.0001
    ...
    ```
</details>

Please note the `markdown=1` tag, without it the content of the `<details>` tag will not be processed appropriately. Also, the two spaces before `<summary>` seem mandatory for the same purpose.

#### ZMDI Icons

Use [zmdi](http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/cheatsheet.html) icons instead of saying "click" the button with 3 stripes:

```text
click the <i class="zmdi zmdi-check zmdi-hc-border"></i> icon
```

will be rendered as: "click the <i class="zmdi zmdi-check zmdi-hc-border"></i> icon".

We use the same ZMDI icon set for the main application. To find the correct ZMDI tag for an icon present on the Exabyte user interface, right click on it within your web browser and click on "Inspect Element". The ZMDI tag should be mentioned within the resulting HTML code describing the user interface.

### Links

#### External Links

Including an external link is best done via a dedicated "Links" footnote section at the bottom of the page, through the `[^1]`, `[^2]`, `[^3]` etc... linking notation (this feature is implemented via the Footnotes [pymdwown extension package](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/footnotes)). For example (note the different style of citation for Websites, PDF documents, Wikipedia articles etc....):

```text
Apple is the main competitor to Microsoft [^1].
    
Mac OS [^2] is the main Operating System developed by Apple.

Mac OS can run VASP, a type of ab-initio simulation code [^3].

Full instructions on how to use VASP can be found in Ref. [^4].
    
## Links
    
[^1]: [Microsoft, Official Website](www.microsoft.com)
[^2]: [Mac OS, Official Website](www.apple.com/mac-os.html)
[^3]: [Wikipedia Ab-initio, Website](www.wikipedia.org/ab-initio-simulations.html)
[^4]: [VASP manual, Document](www.vasp.com/user-manual.pdf)

///FOOTNOTES GO HERE///
```

By default, footnotes are included at the bottom of the page. `///FOOTNOTES GO HERE///` statement is necessary to include them elsewhere.

#### Links to Other Documentation Pages

Including a local link to another page in the documentation, or a specific sub-header section within that page, is done with the following notations respectively. 

```text
We explain service levels [in this page](../../pricing/service-levels.md)
```

```text
The particular information can be found [here](../../pricing/service-levels.md#pricing)
```

Use **ONLY RELATIVE** paths starting from the current page, not the absolute ones.

### Images and Animations

Images (.png, .gif) are stored inside [images](images) directory and are automatically hosted on Git LFS. 
This is an acceptable way to contribute images, as long as the size is kept small (below 1Mb each) in order to avoid exceeding Github LFS quota.

> Note: Do NOT put videos inside this directory! Upload the video into your preferred online storage system such as Google Drive, DropBox, or YouTube, and share its link with us to review and put it up online.

Put images in separate folders within the main "images" directory, one for each top level section of the documentation. 
Also in this case it is essential to use **RELATIVE** and not absolute paths to the image, starting from the current page. 

A few conventions to use when naming images:

1. Try to use hyphen-case for naming the images. for example, `this-is-a-good-image-name.png`; this makes it easy for a
search engine to understand what the image is, and keeps the words neatly separated.

2. Avoid "keyword-stuffing," which search engines penalize. For example, in an image of copper nanoparticles, a
good image title might be "icosahedral-copper-nanoparticle-blue-background." A "keyword-stuffed" version of this
might be "copper-cu-nanoparticle-np-icosahedron-chemistry-nanomaterials-chemical-engineering-catalysis.png." A good rule of
thumb for whether an image title is keyword-stuffed or not is to ask: "Is this a natural way of describing the
image that would actually be used in a spoken conversation?"

#### Including Images

Including an image/screenshot is done as follows, in MKDocs notation (don't use HTML tags).

```markdown
![Alt-Text](../path/to/the/image.png "Optional Title")
```

For example:

```markdown
![Simulation Diagram](../../images/simulation-job-wokflow-unit-explained.png "Simulation Diagram")
```

Alt-text is a [short description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute)
of the image being used. This is generally intended to provide an accessible description of the image for those who are
using screen readers. A few guidelines for the alt-text:

- Try to keep the image descriptions under 100 characters, since some screen readers will limit the number of characters
  it uses when describing an image to someone.
- Don't begin with redundant phrases such as "This is an image of...", "This picture shows...", etc. Just describe what's in
the image. For example, instead of "This picture shows a plate of spam and eggs," instead write "Plate of spam and eggs"
  
Note that alt-text generally used as part of search indexing in addition to the image title, so try to think about keywords for the image and the page,
and weave them (organically) into the alt-text.

The Optional Title (quotes after the path to the image) is the mouseover text that is generated. Generally, it should be
simple and human-readable.


#### Including GIFs

GIFs should be stored in the same image folders as normal images (see above). Including a GIF image is done as follows. 

```text
<img data-gifffer="/images/AddCredit.gif" />
```

In this case, absolute paths to the GIF need to be used, since we insert GIFs directly with HTML and relative paths don't work with HTML commands.

We use a third-party plugin, embedded into the source of this repository ("giffer") in order to make gif images clickable like videos.

#### Embedding Youtube Videos

Youtube videos can be embedded within documentation page through the following block of commands, linking to the video's identifier present in its URL:

```text
<div class="video-wrapper">
<iframe class="gifffer" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBpd-yKUCM4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

#### Clickable Image Maps

Including a clickable image map is done as follows. Note that absolute paths to the image are required in this case, since we have to use HTML commands which don't work with relative paths.


```text
<img src="/images/workflow-designer-initial.png" usemap="#mapname">

<map name="mapname">
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,91,190,512" href="/workflow-designer/sidebar-items/">
    <area shape="rect" coords="190,91,754,512" href="/workflow-designer/source-editor-intro/">
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,28,754,91" href="/workflow-designer/header-menu-actions">
</map>

<!-- 
    coords="x1,y1,x2,y2"
    x1=top left X coordinate
    y1=top left Y coordinate
    x2=bottom right X coordinate
    y2=bottom right Y coordinate
-->
```

### Code Blocks

#### JSON Schemas and Examples

Including resolved JSON schemas and associated examples should be done within dedicated `data.md` pages for each concept being explained.
    
The [markdown_include](https://github.com/Exabyte-io/markdown-include) package is used to include JSON content into markdown documents, by putting direct links to pages inside the [ESSE repository](https://github.com/Exabyte-io/exabyte-esse) instead of copying their contents in the main documentation.

```text

    ```json tab="Schema" 
    {!esse/schema/file_path/file_name.json!}
    ```
    ```json tab="Example" 
    {!esse/example/file_path/file_name.json!}
    ```

```

#### Code Snippets 

Use the following conventions: "object" to quote object or concept, or `button` (between ` ticks as opposed to " quotes) to cite user interface icons or command-line statements in-line. 

Extended code blocks should be enclosed between pairs of triple ticks with name of interpreter for the language being shown, like so:

    ```bash
    exec something
    VARIABLE = "Example"
    print "Hello World"
    ```
    
#### Latex Math Equations

Math equations written in Latex can be inserted within documentation pages (after installing requirements - see instructions at the top of this page) both in-line and as separate blocks, using the dollar notation as shown in the following example:

```text
We define the Average Pressure $p_{avg}$ of a Material according to the following conventional formula.

$$
p_{avg}=-\frac{1}{3} \mathrm{Tr} \hspace{1pt} {\boldsymbol{\sigma}}
$$ 
```
