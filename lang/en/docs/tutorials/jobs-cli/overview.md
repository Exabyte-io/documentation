# Tutorials on Jobs via Command Line Interface

We explain how the user can go through the procedure for [submitting jobs via the Command Line Interface (CLI)](../../jobs-cli/overview.md) of our platform with the help of the following tutorials.

## [Creating and Running Jobs](job-cli-example.md)

[This first tutorial](job-cli-example.md) explains how to create the input scripts for running a materials science computation with the [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso/overview.md) modeling application. We also explain how to submit the corresponding [simulation job](../../jobs/overview.md) to the [Resource Manager](../../infrastructure/resource/overview.md) of our computational [infrastructure](../../infrastructure/overview.md) via the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md).

## [Import Command Line Jobs to Web Interface](cli-job-import.md)

[This tutorial](cli-job-import.md) explains how to import the results of a [job](../../jobs-cli/overview.md) run via [command-line interface](../../cli/overview.md) to the main [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md) of our platform.
