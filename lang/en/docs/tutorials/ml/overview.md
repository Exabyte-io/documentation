# Machine Learning Tutorials

In the present section, we introduce the basic functionality of the [Machine Learning (ML)](../../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md) operations supported on our platform, implemented through the [Exabyte Machine Learning Engine](../../software-directory/machine-learning/exabyte/overview.md) component of our [software](../../software/classification/machine-learning.md).

## Train ML Model

We explain how a **ML model** can be **trained**, based on a set of results of band-gap computations, [in this tutorial page](train-ml-model.md).

## Predict New Properties with ML

The ML model trained in the above-mentioned initial tutorial can then be employed to statistically **predict** the band-gap of other similar materials, without the need for further computations. We explain how this can be achieved [in this other tutorial](predict-ml-properties.md).
