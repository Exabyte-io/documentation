# Running MatterSim and Other Python-Based Machine Learning Models

[MatterSim](https://github.com/microsoft/mattersim) is a deep-learning
interatomic potential trained across the periodic table for materials
property prediction. This page describes how to run MatterSim and other
Python-based Machine Learning (ML) models on the Mat3ra platform, in three
approaches of increasing customization:

1. Using a pre-built [workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) from the
[Mat3ra bank](../../workflows/bank.md).
2. Creating a new workflow from one of the available MatterSim
flavors/<wbr/>templates.
3. Using the general Python flavor/<wbr/>template and supplying the
dependencies through `requirements.txt`.

The page also covers running jobs on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and
utilizing multi-threading, and closes with a step-by-step video walkthrough.

## 1. Using a bank workflow

A common approach is to import an existing workflow from the
[Mat3ra bank](../../workflows/bank.md) into the user's account.

### 1.1. Importing a bank workflow

- Navigate to the *Workflows Bank* page from the left sidebar.
- Search for `MatterSim` and click **Copy** in the *Action* column on the
desired workflow (e.g. *MatterSim total energy*). See
[Copy bank workflow](../../workflows/actions/copy-bank.md) for details.

    ![Copy bank workflow](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-bank-workflow.webp "Copy bank workflow")

- The workflow then appears in the user's *Workflows* list and becomes
available for selection during job creation.
- The workflow can be opened for inspection or further modification. The
*MatterSim total energy* workflow consists of three [units](../../workflows/components/units.md):

    - **I/O Material unit:** fetches the input materials from the job
    context. Its output is an array of materials.
    - **Assignment unit:** takes the first item of that array and
    assigns it to a new global variable named `MATERIAL`.
    - **MatterSim unit:** builds an [Atomic Simulation Environment
    (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) material definition from
    `MATERIAL` and runs MatterSim to predict the total energy (eV), stress,
    and other properties.

    In addition to the main `script.py`, the MatterSim unit exposes a
    `utils.py` helper script and a `requirements.txt` file. Extra Python
    packages required by the script can be added to `requirements.txt`.

    ![MatterSim workflow units](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-workflow.webp "MatterSim workflow units")

### 1.2. Create and submit a job

- Open the [Jobs Designer](../../jobs-designer/overview.md) from the left
sidebar and click **Create New Job**
(see [Create job](../../jobs/actions/create.md)). The page is organized in
three sections: [material](../../jobs-designer/materials-tab.md),
[workflow](../../jobs-designer/workflow-tab.md), and
[compute parameters](../../jobs-designer/compute-tab.md).
- In the **Select Job Actions** drop-down, choose the material and the
workflow:

    - **Material:** any structure is acceptable; the default is
    Silicon, while the video walkthrough below uses a nickel slab.
    - **Workflow** &mdash; the *MatterSim total energy* workflow imported
    in the previous section.

- The job can be renamed (e.g. *MatterSim total energy*) and the
[compute parameters](../../jobs-designer/compute-tab.md) (cluster, queue,
number of processors, time limit, and others) can be adjusted under the
*Compute* section.
- Save and exit the Jobs Designer.

    ![MatterSim job creation](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-job.webp "MatterSim job creation")

- Click **Run** in the *Actions* column to [submit](../../jobs/actions/run.md)
the job.
- Once the job completes, the [Job Viewer](../../jobs/ui/viewer.md)
exposes the results:

    - The [*Results* tab](../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) shows a summary of
    the predicted output properties.
    - The *Workflow* tab &rarr; *MatterSim* unit exposes the standard
    output (raw log).
    - The [*Files* tab](../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md) lists every input and
    output file for preview or download.

    ![MatterSim total energy results](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-results-total-energy.webp "MatterSim total energy results")


## 2. Creating a new workflow

When the desired workflow is not available in the bank, a new one can be
built from an existing MatterSim flavor/<wbr/>template. The example below
creates a *cell relaxation* workflow from scratch.

- Open the [Workflows](../../workflows/overview.md) page and click
**Create** to start a new workflow.
- Expand the *Details* section and select **Python Script** as the
application.
- Add an **Executable** unit and click **EDIT** to open the
[Unit Editor](../../workflow-designer/unit-editor.md).

    ![MatterSim add unit](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-add-unit.webp "MatterSim add unit")

- Expand the *Details* section and select `mlff:mattersim:cell_relaxation`
(under the *Machine Learning Force Field* category) as the flavor.

    ![MatterSim edit unit](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-edit-unit.webp "MatterSim edit unit")

- Scroll down to edit the Python script if necessary. As an example,
in order to use ASE to build the input material directly (instead of
pulling it from the job context), the material section can be replaced
with:

    ```python title="SCRIPT.PY"
    ...
    from ase.build import bulk
    # Lattice constants in Angstrom (Å)
    ase_atoms = bulk("GaN", "wurtzite", a=3.189, c=5.185)
    ...
    ```

    where `GaN` denotes Gallium Nitride.

- Close the Unit Editor by clicking the **X** button in the top right.
- Save and exit the workflow editor.
- Create and run a job using this workflow as in the previous section.

    ![MatterSim cell relaxation results](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/mattersim-results-cell-relaxation.webp "MatterSim cell relaxation results")

Once the job completes, the *Results* tab shows a side-by-side comparison
of the initial and relaxed structures, and the *Files* tab contains both
structures in `.cif` and `.poscar` formats.


## 3. Using the general Python template

In order to run any Python-based ML model that is not covered by an
existing workflow or flavor, the general Python flavor/<wbr/>template can
be used:

- Create a new workflow as in the previous section, and select the
default `python` flavor/<wbr/>template.
- Add the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` tab.
- Write the code in the `script.py` tab.

![General Python template](../../images/tutorials/mattersim/general-py-template.webp "General Python template")

As long as the model is Python-based and its dependencies can be installed
via `pip`, it runs on the Mat3ra platform.

!!!info "Shared virtual environment"
    Python virtual environments are shared across jobs and users. As long
    as the content (hash/fingerprint) of `requirements.txt` is unchanged,
    the same environment is reused. The first job may take longer to
    complete because of `pip install`, but subsequent runs start faster as
    no install is required. If the expected versions of the dependencies
    are not picked up, they should be pinned explicitly in
    `requirements.txt`.

!!!tip "Multi-threading"
    If the model can use multi-threading, the relevant environment variables
    should be set at the top of the script; before importing NumPy or any other
    library that utilizes them.

    ```python title="SCRIPT.PY"
    import os

    # Number of CPU threads
    ncore = "2"

    # Must be set before importing numpy or other thread-aware libraries
    os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = ncore
    os.environ["OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS"] = ncore
    os.environ["MKL_NUM_THREADS"] = ncore
    os.environ["VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS"] = ncore
    os.environ["NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS"] = ncore
    ```


## 4. Running on GPU

Because MatterSim is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based model, it
benefits significantly from GPU execution. In order to run a MatterSim
job on GPU, it should be submitted to one of the platform's GPU queues.
For example, `GOF` queue on the [Google Cloud cluster](../../clusters/google.md)
(internal identifier `Cluster-001`).

In order to verify that the job actually runs on GPU, a debug print can be
added to the script and the standard output can be inspected under the
*Files* tab once the job completes:

```python title="SCRIPT.PY"
import torch

print("Using GPU:", torch.cuda.is_available())
```

For non-PyTorch frameworks the equivalent check should be used (for
example, `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` for TensorFlow).

When the run succeeds, the *Results* tab shows the phonon dispersion and
the phonon density-of-states plots.
