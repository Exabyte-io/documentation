We will focus on creating silicon nanowires with hydrogen passivation from FIG. 1.

Specifically, the material from FIG. 1. of the publication:

![Passivated Silicon nanowire](../../../images/tutorials/materials/passivation/passivation_edge_silicon_nanowire/0-figure-from-manuscript.webp "Passivated Silicon nanowire, FIG. 1.")


## 1. Create Silicon Nanowire.

### 1.1. Load Silicon Material.

Since we're using Silicon, it can be already loaded as the default material and we can skip this step.

Otherwise, we navigate to [Materials Designer](../../../materials-designer/overview.md) and import the silicon material from the [Standata](../../../materials-designer/header-menu/input-output/standata-import.md).

### 1.2. Launch JupyterLite Session.

Select the "Advanced > [JupyterLite Transformation](../../../materials-designer/header-menu/advanced/jupyterlite-dialog.md)" menu item to launch the JupyterLite environment.

![JupyterLite Dialog](/images/jupyterlite/md-advanced-jl.webp "JupyterLite Dialog")

### 1.3. Open `create_nanowire_custom_shapeipynb` notebook.

Find `create_nanowire_custom_shape.ipynb` in the list of notebooks and click/double-click open it.

### 1.4. Open and modify the notebook.

Next, we need to create a nanowire wit ha custom shape.

We'll specify the orientation of the nanowire with Miller indices of `(1,1,0)` as described in the manuscript.

Then we'll define a supercell matrix to add enough of material to cut the nanowire from: 

`[[3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2]]`.

Finally, we'll define a custom coordinate condition to create a rhombus-shaped nanowire with coordinates of the vertices corresponding to the corners of the rhombus.

The vertices of the rhombus are defined as follows:

Bottom:`[0.5, 0.2, 0]`, 

Left:`[0, 0.5, 0]`,

Top:`[0.5, 1, 0]`,

Right:`[1, 0.5, 0]`


For that, edit `create_nanowire_custom_shape.ipynb` notebook to modify the parameters by adding the following content to the "1.1. Set up nanowire parameters" cell:

```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
from mat3ra.made.tools.utils.coordinate import CoordinateCondition
# Flag to use Cartesian coordinates for the center and radii
USE_CARTESIAN_COORDINATES = False 

# Miller indices of the nanowire direction
MILLER_INDICES= (1,1,0)  
# Supercell matrix to cut the cylinder from
SUPERCELL_MATRIX = [[3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2]] 
# Vacuum thickness on the sides in Angstroms
VACUUM = 10.0 
ALIGN_ALONG_X = False

# Custom Coordinate Condition for
class CustomCoordinateCondition(CoordinateCondition):
    vertices: List[List[float]]

    def condition(self, coordinate: List[float]) -> bool:
        coord = np.array(coordinate)
        v0, v1, v2, v3 = np.array(self.vertices)
        vec0 = v1 - v0
        vec1 = v2 - v1
        vec2 = v3 - v2
        vec3 = v0 - v3

        # Calculate cross products
        cross0 = np.cross(vec0, coord[:2] - v0[:2])
        cross1 = np.cross(vec1, coord[:2] - v1[:2])
        cross2 = np.cross(vec2, coord[:2] - v2[:2])
        cross3 = np.cross(vec3, coord[:2] - v3[:2])

        # Check if point is inside the rhombus
        return (np.all(cross0 >= 0) and np.all(cross1 >= 0) and \
                np.all(cross2 >= 0) and np.all(cross3 >= 0)) or \
               (np.all(cross0 <= 0) and np.all(cross1 <= 0) and \
                np.all(cross2 <= 0) and np.all(cross3 <= 0))

# Define the vertices of the rhombus
vertices = [
    [0.5, 0.2, 0],
    [0, 0.5, 0],
    [0.5, 1, 0],
    [1, 0.5, 0]
]

condition = CustomCoordinateCondition(vertices=vertices).condition
```

## 1.5. Run the Notebook and use the Material.

Run the notebook by clicking `Run` > `Run All` in the top menu to run cells and wait for the results to appear.

![Run All](/images/jupyterlite/run-all.webp "Run All")

After running the notebook and submitting the material, the user will be able to visualize the structure of Silicon Nanowire.

![Silicon Nanowire](../../../images/tutorials/materials/passivation/passivation_edge_silicon_nanowire/3-silicon-nanowire.webp "Silicon Nanowire")

## 2. Passivate with Hydrogen.

### 2.1. Setup the Passivation.

Open JupyterLite Session again and select Silicon Nanowire material for Input Materials.

Next, we need to passivate the silicon nanowire with hydrogen atoms.

Open the `passivate_edge.ipynb` notebook and set:

`BOND_LENGTH = 1.46` -- Si-H bond length in Angstroms,

`COORDINATION_THRESHOLD = 3` -- Silicon that has less than 4 neighbors is undercoordinated in the silicon lattice, so all with 3 or less neighbors will be passivated,

`COORDINATION_SEARCH_RADIUS = 2.5` -- Search radius for neighbors for every atom, in Angstroms,

`MAX_BONDS_TO_PASSIVATE = 2`  -- Maximum number of bonds to saturate for undercoordinated atoms.


Copy the below content and edit the "1.1. Set up defect parameters" cell in the notebook as follows:

```python
# Enable interactive selection of coordination threshold
IS_COORDINATION_SELECTION_INTERACTIVE = False

MATERIAL_INDEX = 0

BOND_LENGTH = 1.46 # in Angstroms
PASSIVANT = "H" # Chemical symbol of the passivant
COORDINATION_SEARCH_RADIUS = 2.5 # in Angstroms (sphere in which to search for neighbors)
COORDINATION_THRESHOLD = 3 # Coordination number below which to passivate
MAX_BONDS_TO_SATURATE = 2 # Maximum number of bonds to saturate

SYMMETRY_TOLERANCE = 0.1 

SHOW_INTERMEDIATE_STEPS = True
CELL_REPETITIONS_FOR_VISUALIZATION = [1, 1, 1] 
```

Here's the visual of the updated content:

### 2.2. Run the notebook and analyze the results.

After running the notebook, the user will be able to visualize the structure of Silicon Nanowire with substitution defects.

![Review the Results](../../../images/tutorials/materials/passivation/passivation_edge_silicon_nanowire/6-jl-result-preview.webp "Review the Results")

## 3. Pass the Material to Materials Designer.

The user can pass the material with substitution defects in the current Materials Designer environment and save it.

![Final Material](../../../images/tutorials/materials/passivation/passivation_edge_silicon_nanowire/7-wave-result.webp "H-Passivated Silicon Nanowire")

Or the user can [save or download](../../../materials-designer/header-menu/input-output.md) the material in Material JSON format or POSCAR format.
