# Gr/Ni(111) Registry and Work of Adhesion

## 1. Introduction

This tutorial reproduces the structure and energetics of graphene on Ni(111) — which registry the
film adopts, how far it sits above the surface, and the work of adhesion of each arrangement —
using the interface created in the
[structure creation tutorial](optimization-interface-film-xy-position-graphene-nickel.md).

    **Arjun Dahal, Matthias Batzill**,
    "Graphene-nickel interfaces: a review" Nanoscale, 6(5), 2548 (2014)
    [DOI: 10.1039/c3nr05279f](https://doi.org/10.1039/c3nr05279f) [@Dahal2014]

    Its computed values are from **Jayeeta Lahiri et al.**, "Graphene growth and stability at nickel
    surfaces", New J. Phys. 13, 025001 (2011)
    [DOI: 10.1088/1367-2630/13/2/025001](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/13/2/025001) [@Lahiri2011]

### 1.1. What is being reproduced

Graphene and Ni(111) are lattice-matched to within a fraction of a percent, so the film locks into
a 1×1 registry. The review's section 2.1 collects the established structural facts: LEED I–V and
ion scattering identify the adsorbed structure as one carbon **atop** a first-layer Ni atom and the
other in the **fcc hollow**, 0.211 nm above the surface, with a 0.005 nm buckling in which the atop
carbon sits further out. The review's computed values come from Lahiri *et al.* [@Lahiri2011]
(New J. Phys. 13, 025001 (2011), open access), whose Table 1 is the quantitative target here:

| interface | work of adhesion (J/m²) | separation (Å) |
|---|---|---|
| fcc (atop + fcc hollow) | 0.81 | 2.16 |
| hcp (atop + hcp hollow) | 0.77 | 2.17 |
| hollow (fcc + hcp hollows) | 0.31 | 3.26 |

The bridge registry (Fig. 1d of the review) is not quantified in either paper and is computed as
an extra point beyond the published set.

![The four registries of graphene on a close-packed metal surface](../../../images/tutorials/materials/optimization/optimization_interface_film_xy_position_graphene_nickel/0-figure-from-manuscript.webp "Registries of graphene on a close-packed metal surface")

### 1.2. The published recipe, and why relaxation is not optional

Lahiri *et al.* state their method plainly: **LDA**, because "GGA does not provide an adequate
description of Ni–graphene bonding" for this interface; spin-polarized throughout; and **geometry
relaxation** with the bottom substrate layers fixed. The buckling is itself one of the published
numbers, and no rigid placement can produce a buckling — so every result in this tutorial comes
from a relaxed structure, and rigid scans are used only to bracket the starting separations.

## 2. Prerequisites

Run the [structure creation tutorial](optimization-interface-film-xy-position-graphene-nickel.md)
first. Its notebook builds the Gr/Ni(111) interface and saves it into the `uploads` folder as
`Graphene_Nickel_interface`; the simulation notebook loads it back by exactly that name and stops
if it is missing. The reduced cell is the 1×1 match: 2 carbon and 4 nickel atoms.

## 3. What is calculated

Two tiers, both relaxed.

**Fast tier — MACE-MP, run where the notebook runs.** Each registry is placed (the surface sites are
measured from the substrate's own top layers, and each registry label is re-verified after
relaxation; a structure that slid into a neighbouring registry is dropped rather than reported
under the wrong name), bracketed by a rigid scan, then relaxed with the bottom substrate layers
fixed — the paper's scheme. Same-cell relaxed references (bare Ni slab, free-standing graphene) turn
the energies into works of adhesion: `W = [E(slab) + E(graphene) − E(interface)] / A`.

The fast tier does not reproduce the paper, and says so. MACE-MP is PBE-trained, and PBE-level
physics is what the paper rejects for this interface. Run natively with D3 dispersion, it gives
fcc 0.17 J/m² against the paper's 0.81, a separation of 1.98 Å against 2.16, and the atop carbon
buckled toward the surface rather than away; the dispersion-bound hollow it does place near the
paper's energy (0.30 against 0.31 J/m², though at 4.08 Å rather than 3.26). In the browser embed
below, `torch-dftd` is not available, so the same tier runs without dispersion and the hollow
registry reports itself unbound. What the fast tier delivers is the registry set, the two-branch
energy landscape and the starting geometries for the precise tier; its table prints the MACE
numbers beside the paper's so the gap is visible.

**Precise tier — the paper's LDA on the platform.** One fixed-cell relaxation per selected registry,
starting from the MACE-relaxed geometry, plus the two same-cell references — LDA (`pz`, GBRV
ultrasoft; the platform carries the LDA set for both Ni and C), spin-polarized for the Ni-containing
structures and unpolarized for the non-magnetic graphene reference, no dispersion correction,
matching the paper: LDA binds this interface unaided, which is the stated reason its authors chose
it. Each job's final structure is read back, so separation and buckling are compared as well as the
work of adhesion. This tier carries the reproduction claim.

| registry | Fig. 1 | carbon sublattices | published target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `atop_fcc` | (b) | atop + fcc hollow | 0.81 J/m² at 2.16 Å, favourable |
| `atop_hcp` | (c) | atop + hcp hollow | 0.77 J/m² at 2.17 Å |
| `hollow` | (a) | fcc + hcp hollows | 0.31 J/m² at 3.26 Å — dispersion-bound |
| `bridge` | (d) | C–C bond straddling a first-layer Ni | beyond the published set |

## 4. Calculation parameters

| | fast tier | precise tier | Lahiri et al. |
|---|---|---|---|
| Method | MACE-MP-0 (large, float64) + D3 | LDA (`pz`), GBRV ultrasoft | LDA, all-electron LCAO (DMol) |
| Spin | via training data | collinear, moment started at 0.7 μB on Ni; graphene reference unpolarized | spin-polarized (bulk Ni: 0.56 μB) |
| Relaxation | BFGS, bottom 2 Ni layers fixed | fixed-cell relaxation (`pw_relax`, `calculation = 'relax'`) | bottom 2 of 5 Ni layers fixed |
| Cutoffs | — | 40 / 200 Ry (GBRV's published pair) | all-electron |
| k-grid | — | 12×12×1 (multiple of 3, so K is on the mesh) | converged, not stated |
| Smearing | — | Marzari-Vanderbilt cold, `degauss = 0.01` Ry | not stated |
| Dispersion | D3 | none — matching the paper | none |

Stated divergences from the paper: the slab is the structure tutorial's 4 Ni layers rather than 5;
the vacuum is 20 Å rather than 90; the platform relaxation cannot hold the bottom layers fixed
(the fast tier can, and does); plane-wave pseudopotentials rather than all-electron LCAO. The SCF
convergence settings (cold smearing, `local-TF` mixing, `mixing_beta = 0.2`, 200 iterations) exist
because the platform defaults stop at "convergence NOT achieved after 100 iterations" on this
spin-polarized metal slab, with the energy oscillating in its fourth decimal — charge sloshing.

## 5. Step-by-step instructions

### 5.1. Create the structure

Run the [structure creation notebook](optimization-interface-film-xy-position-graphene-nickel.md).
It saves `Graphene_Nickel_interface` into `uploads`.

### 5.2. Open the simulation notebook

```
other/materials_designer/specific_examples/optimization_interface_film_xy_position_graphene_nickel_SIMULATION.ipynb
```

### 5.3. Run the fast tier

*Run* > *Run All Cells*. Sections 2–4 need no platform account: they load the interface, derive and
verify the registries, relax each one with MACE, and print the comparison against Lahiri Table 1 —
including the honest `[MACE tier]` verdict.

### 5.4. Run the precise tier

Section 5 authenticates and submits, per selected registry, a relaxation + total-energy job at the
paper's LDA, plus the two reference jobs. A default run selects one registry — three jobs. Leaving
`DFT_REGISTRY_NAMES` **empty** skips the platform tier entirely; the automated test does exactly
that, because relaxation jobs outlast what a browser test may wait for.

### 5.5. Read the verdict

The final cell restates the published targets and prints one verdict line per tier, of the form
`Reproduces Lahiri et al. Table 1 [<tier>]: yes|no`. The fast tier's line reads `no` — the physics
working as documented, see section 3. The DFT-tier line is printed once the selected registries and
both references have finished, over whatever was selected; the ordering check needs all three.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If a registry's rigid scan finds no bracketed minimum, widen the scan window. If every registry
comes back physisorbed-only in the fast tier, check `MACE_MODEL` and `MACE_DEFAULT_DTYPE` — the
medium/float32 combination misses the chemisorbed minimum entirely. The first MACE call downloads
the foundation model; later runs use the cache. If a platform job stops at "convergence NOT
achieved", the smearing/mixing block in the parameters cell is the knob — those settings exist
precisely because the defaults do not converge this slab.

## 7. Interactive JupyterLite notebook
