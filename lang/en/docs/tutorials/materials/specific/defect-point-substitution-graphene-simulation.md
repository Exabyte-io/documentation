# Substitutional Point Defects in Graphene (Band Structure)

## Introduction.

This tutorial demonstrates the calculation of the band structure for graphene with vacancy and N substitutions, reproducing results from the following manuscript:

!!!note "Manuscript"
    Yoshitaka Fujimoto and Susumu Saito, "Formation, stabilities, and electronic properties of nitrogen defects in graphene", Physical Review B, 2011. [DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.84.245446](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.245446){:target='_blank'}. [@Yoshitaka2011]

This tutorial builds upon the [Substitutional Point Defects in Graphene](defect-point-substitution-graphene.md) tutorial, where we created the N-doped graphene structure. Here, we calculate its electronic band structure using Quantum ESPRESSO and compare with the published results.

The figure below shows the band structure and atomic structure of N-doped graphene from the manuscript (Figure 3a):

The calculation uses density functional theory (DFT) with the local density approximation (LDA) and norm-conserving pseudopotentials, following the methodology described in the manuscript.

## Prerequisites.

Before starting this tutorial, you should:

1. Complete the [Substitutional Point Defects in Graphene](defect-point-substitution-graphene.md) tutorial to create the N-doped graphene structure, OR
2. Have the N-doped graphene material file saved in the `uploads` folder

## Workflow Overview.

The band structure calculation workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Set up the environment and parameters**: Configure material, workflow, and computational settings
2. **Authenticate and initialize API client**: Connect to the platform
3. **Load material**: Import the N-doped graphene structure from file or Standata
4. **Create workflow**: Set up the band structure calculation workflow with optional relaxation
5. **Configure compute resources**: Select cluster, queue, and processor settings
6. **Create and submit job**: Assemble and run the calculation
7. **Monitor job status**: Wait for completion
8. **Retrieve and visualize results**: Display the calculated band structure

## Calculation Parameters.

### Run Profiles.

The notebook supports two run profiles:

- **Debug mode**: Quick validation run with minimal k-point sampling and no relaxation. Completes in a few minutes.
- **Production mode**: Paper-quality settings with structural relaxation and dense k-point sampling, following Fujimoto & Saito (2011).

### DFT Parameters.

The calculation uses the following DFT parameters (consistent with the manuscript):

- **Functional**: LDA (Perdew-Zunger parametrization)
- **Pseudopotentials**: Norm-conserving (ONCV)
- **Energy cutoff**: 50 Ry for wavefunctions, 200 Ry for density
- **K-point grid** (production): 6×6×1 for SCF and relaxation
- **K-path**: K → Γ → M → K (high-symmetry path in hexagonal Brillouin zone)

### Relaxation Settings.

In production mode, the structure is relaxed before the band structure calculation to optimize atomic positions while maintaining the cell parameters.

## Step-by-Step Instructions.

### 1. Open the Notebook.

Navigate to the API examples repository and open the band structure calculation notebook:

```
other/materials_designer/specific_examples/defect_point_substitution_graphene_simulation.ipynb
```

### 2. Configure Parameters.

In cell 1.2, set the run profile and material parameters:

```python
# Switch between "debug" and "production" modes
RUN_PROFILE = "debug"  # Change to "production" for paper-quality results

# Material parameters
FOLDER = "./uploads"
MATERIAL_NAME = "N-doped Graphene"

# Workflow parameters
APPLICATION_NAME = "espresso"
MODEL_SUBTYPE = "lda"
```

For first-time use, start with `"debug"` mode to validate the workflow. Once confirmed working, switch to `"production"` for final results.

### 3. Set DFT Parameters.

The specific DFT parameters are configured in cell 1.3:

```python
# Pseudopotential settings
PSEUDOPOTENTIAL_TYPE = "nc"
FUNCTIONAL = "pz"

# Energy cutoffs
ECUTWFC = 50
ECUTRHO = 4 * ECUTWFC

# K-point sampling and path (automatically set based on RUN_PROFILE)
```

### 4. Run the Notebook.

Execute all cells by selecting `Run` > `Run All` from the menu.

The notebook will:

1. [Authenticate with the platform](../../../jupyterlite/authentication.md) and initialize the API client
2. Load the N-doped graphene material
3. Create and configure the band structure workflow
4. Submit the calculation job
5. Monitor the job status
6. Display the results when complete

### 5. Monitor Progress.

The notebook includes automatic job monitoring with status updates. In debug mode, the calculation typically completes in 5-10 minutes. Production mode may take several hours depending on the cluster load.

### 6. Analyze Results.

Once the job completes, the band structure will be displayed automatically. The plot shows:

- Energy bands along the K → Γ → M → K path
- Fermi level position
- Band gap (if present)
- Comparison with pristine graphene (if available)

## Expected Results.

The calculated band structure should show:

- **Modified electronic structure** near the Fermi level due to nitrogen substitution
- **Breaking of symmetry** compared to pristine graphene
- **Localized states** introduced by the nitrogen defects
- **Band gap opening** (depending on defect configuration)

### Comparison with Published Results

The figure below compares the band structure from the Fujimoto & Saito manuscript (left) with our calculated results (right):

![Band Structure Comparison](../../../images/tutorials/materials/defects/defect_creation_point_substitution_graphene/band-structure-comparison.webp "Comparison of band structure: manuscript (left) vs. calculated (right)")

The calculated band structure reproduces the key features from the manuscript, including:

- The overall band dispersion along the K → Γ → M → K path
- The position of bands relative to the Fermi level
- The electronic structure modifications due to nitrogen substitution
- The characteristic features near the K and Γ points

## Customization Options.

### Modifying K-path.

To change the k-point path for band structure calculation, edit the `KPATH` parameter in cell 1.3:

```python
KPATH = [
    {"point": "K", "steps": 20},
    {"point": "Г", "steps": 20},
    {"point": "M", "steps": 20},
    {"point": "K", "steps": 1},
]
```

### Adjusting Computational Resources.

Modify the compute parameters in cell 1.2:

```python
CLUSTER_NAME = "101"  # Your cluster name
QUEUE_NAME = QueueName.D  # Queue selection
PPN = 1  # Processors per node
```

### Adding or Removing Relaxation.

Toggle structural relaxation by changing the `ADD_RELAXATION` flag (automatically set by `RUN_PROFILE`):

```python
ADD_RELAXATION = True  # Enable relaxation
RELAXATION_KGRID = [6, 6, 1]  # K-point grid for relaxation
```

## Troubleshooting.

### Material Not Found.

If the material is not found in the uploads folder:

1. Run the [defect creation notebook](defect-point-substitution-graphene.md) first
2. Ensure the material is saved with the exact name that is used ("N-doped Graphene")
3. Check that the material file is in the correct `uploads` folder
