    "description": "This video animation demonstrates how to create an interpolated set, necessary for the calculation of the energy profile and activation barrier for the multi-dimensional energy space of chemical reactions via the Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) method. Since the molecules considered in this example are entirely one-dimensional, we include atomic constraints limiting the movement of atoms to only this single dimension.",
