    "description": "This tutorial page explains how to calculate the electronic band structure of semiconducting materials based on the GW Approximation operated in conjunction with the plasmon pole approach. We consider a film of Boron Nitride (BN) as an example, and use Quantum ESPRESSO as our main simulation engine, operated in conjunction with the SternheimerGW code.",
