# Electronic Properties Tutorials

In the present section, we introduce the most common operations supported on our platform for performing **electronic structure** computations on materials, implemented through the [Density Functional Theory model](../../../models-directory/dft/overview.md).

## [Band Structure](band-structure.md)

We review the procedure for computing the [electronic band structure](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/bandstructure.md) of crystalline samples [in this tutorial](band-structure.md).

## [Band Gap](band-gap.md)

The calculation of the [band gap](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/band-gaps.md) is explained [here](band-gap.md).

## [Density of States](density-of-states.md)

We also offer instructions on how to evaluate the [electronic Density of States](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/electronic-dos.md) under [this other tutorial page](density-of-states.md).

## [Charge Density Mesh](electronic-density-mesh.md)

Finally, we conclude our review of the electronic properties of materials by covering [a tutorial page](electronic-density-mesh.md) dedicated to the computation of the Electronic Charge Density Mesh.

## [Fermi Surface](fermi-surface.md)

We review the steps involved in the calculation and visualization of the [Fermi Surface](../../../properties-directory/scalar/fermi-energy.md) of metallic crystalline samples such as copper [under this page](fermi-surface.md).

## [HSE Calculations](hse-vasp-bg.md)

[In other tutorial](hse-vasp-bg.md), we demonstrate how the use of the hybrid HSE functional can yield more accurate results for the example case of a band-gap computation with [VASP](../../../software-directory/modeling/vasp/overview.md). 

A similar Band Gap calculation with Quantum ESPRESSO is [available here](hse-qe-bg.md). And for the Band Structure - in [this tutorial](hse-qe-bs.md).

## GW Calculations

This [tutorial](gw-vasp-bg.md) illustrate how the results for the Band Gap can be more accurate through the use of the [GW Approximation](../../../models-directory/dft/notes.md#the-gw-approximation).
