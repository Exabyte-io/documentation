# Fermi Surface Calculation

This page explains how to calculate the [Fermi surface](../../../properties-directory/scalar/fermi-energy.md) for metallic copper (Cu) lying in its equilibrium face-centred cubic (fcc) [Bravais Lattice](../../../properties-directory/structural/lattice.md), through the use of [Density Functional Theory](../../../models-directory/dft/overview.md). We will use [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso/overview.md) as our simulation engine for this tutorial.

!!!note "Quantum ESPRESSO version considered in this tutorial"
    The present tutorial is written for Quantum ESPRESSO at versions 5.2.1, 5.4.0, 6.0.0 or 6.3.

## Create Job and Select Material

The user should start by creating a new [Job](../../../jobs/overview.md), through [opening](../../../jobs/actions/create.md) the [Job Designer Interface](../../../jobs-designer/overview.md). The fcc crystal structure of copper should then be [selected and added](../../../jobs-designer/actions-header-menu/select-materials.md) to the new Job being designed, assuming that this structure is already present among the entries listed in the account-owned [collection](../../../accounts/collections.md) of materials.

## Choose Workflow

[Workflows](../../../workflows/overview.md) for calculating the [band structure](../../../properties-directory/non-scalar/bandstructure.md) of [materials](../../../materials/overview.md) with [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso/overview.md) can readily be [imported](../../../workflows/actions/copy-bank.md) from the [Workflows Bank](../../../workflows/bank.md) into the account-owned [collection](../../../accounts/collections.md). This workflow can later be [selected](../../../jobs-designer/actions-header-menu/select-workflow.md) and added to the [Job being created](../../../jobs-designer/workflow-tab.md).

## Set Sampling in Reciprocal Space

It is critical to have a high [k-point density](../../../models/auxiliary-concepts/reciprocal-space/sampling.md) in order to resolve enough details for the Fermi surface plot.

The band structure workflow is composed of two [units](../../../workflows/components/units.md). The first unit specifies the settings for the self-consistent calculation of the energy eigenvalues and wave functions.  The second unit calculation is a non self-consistent calculation using the wave functions and charge density of the previous calculation.

We set the size of the grid of k-points to 18 x 18 x 18 in the first workflow unit. This provides a dense enough k-point sampling in order to resolve the fine features present within the output of the band structure computation. The validity of this choice of k-grid size for yielding accurate results of order meV in the final energy can be verified by performing the relevant [convergence study](../../../models/auxiliary-concepts/reciprocal-space/convergence.md).

## Submit Job

Before [submitting](../../../jobs/actions/run.md) the [job](../../../jobs/overview.md), the user should click on the ["Compute" tab](../../../jobs-designer/compute-tab.md) of [Job Designer](../../../jobs-designer/overview.md) and examine the [compute parameters](../../../infrastructure/compute/parameters.md) included therein.  Copper is a small structure, so 4 CPUs and 1 minute of calculation runtime should be sufficient.

## Examine Final Results

When both [unit](../../../workflows/components/units.md) computations are complete at the end of Job execution, switching to the [Results tab](../../../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../../jobs/ui/viewer.md) will show the final [total energy](../../../properties-directory/scalar/total-energy.md), the [Fermi energy](../../../properties-directory/scalar/fermi-energy.md), and more information about each execution unit.

The user can also browse the actual input and output files that are part of the calculation under the [Files Tab](../../../jobs/ui/files-tab.md) of [Job Viewer](../../../jobs/ui/viewer.md).

## Generate File with Fermi Surface Information

Once the simulation is complete, the user should [open](../../../remote-connection/actions/open-terminal.md) a [Web Terminal session](../../../remote-connection/web-terminal.md) in order to create a file that is essential for visualizing the Fermi surface. The calculation of Fermi surface can in general be performed using the `fs.x` code, part of the [Quantum ESPRESSO](../../../software-directory/modeling/quantum-espresso/overview.md) distribution. The resulting file in `.bxsf` format can then be read and plotted using the [XCrySDen](../../../software-directory/analysis/xcrysden.md) analysis and visualization software.  

In order to generate the post-processing bxsf file, the user should first navigate from within the [Command Line Interface](../../../cli/overview.md) into the [working directory](../../../jobs-cli/batch-scripts/directories.md) containing the simulation input and output files. Once in this directory, a new input file with the following contents should be written using any [command-line text editor](../../../software-directory/development/text-editors.md) (for example `nano`). This new file should be given the name `fs.in` at the moment of saving:

```bash
&fermi
  outdir='./outdir'
  prefix='__prefix__'
/
```

Afterwards, the following commands should be entered, first for [loading](../../../cli/actions/modules-actions.md#load-desired-module) the appropriate Quantum ESPRESSO [module](../../../cli/modules.md) under the Command Line Interface [environment](../../../cli/environment.md), and then for running the `fs.x` executable on the previously-created `fs.in` file:

```bash
module load espresso/540-i-174-impi-044
fs.x < fs.in
```   

After the end of the execution of the above commands, the user will notice a new file that has been created in the current working directory called `__prefix__fs.bxsf`. We shall use this file for the ensuing visualization of the Fermi surface with XCrySDen.

Finally, the user should close the Web Terminal session to return to the original [Web Interface](../../../ui/overview.md) of our platform.

## Visualize Fermi Surface

The next step is to [open](../../../remote-connection/actions/open-desktop.md) a [Remote Desktop Connection](../../../remote-connection/remote-desktop.md), so that graphical interface programs for [visualization purposes](../../../software-directory/overview.md#analysis-tools) can be run.  

The user should now find and [open](../../../remote-connection/actions-rd/open-app.md) the [XCrySDen](../../../software-directory/analysis/xcrysden.md) application.

Within XCrysden, the user should go to `File` -> `Open Structure` -> `Open BXSF`, and then navigate to the directory where the aforementioned `__prefix__fs.bxsf` file was created. This opens a graphical visualization of the Fermi surface, as portrayed in the example screenshot below.
