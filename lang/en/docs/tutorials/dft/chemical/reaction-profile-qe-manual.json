    "description": "In this tutorial, we explain how to calculate the energy reaction profile and activation barrier for the multi-dimensional energy space of chemical reactions via the Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) method, as implemented under Quantum ESPRESSO. In this case, we make use of a manually-generated interpolated set of intermediate images.",
