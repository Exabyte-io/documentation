# Properties Classification

Properties can be classified according to different criteria. We review such classification schemes separately under each of the specific contexts outlined below.

## [General](general.md)

Properties common to both [Materials](../../materials/overview.md) and [Workflows](../../workflows/overview.md) can be classified according to the definitions contained [in this page](general.md).

## [Materials](materials.md)

Materials properties are the object of a separate treatment as explained [here](materials.md).

## [Machine Learning](machine-learning.md)

Some additional specific classification terminology can be introduced when discussing Machine Learning, as explained [in this section](machine-learning.md).
