# Properties Data

We make use of the data convention, introduced [in this page](../../data-structured/convention.md), to organize the information related to properties.

## [JSON Schemas and Examples](../../data-structured/convention.md)

We provide below an example of a [**JSON schema**](../../data-structured/convention.md) for a material property. The reader is referred to the JSON external documentation [^1] [^2] for the explanation of the primitive types and schema keywords.

Also listed below, is an example of a JSON representation of the [total energy](../../properties-directory/scalar/total-energy.md), which can validated by the schema. It consists in a scalar numerical **value**, which is expressed in **units** of electronVolts (eV).

## [Core Schema Types](core.md)

In addition to the default primitive types for JSON Schemas, we construct additional types used for constructing the representations of properties. A list of available schema types are provided [in this page](core.md).

## [List of Schemas](list.md)

[In this section](list.md), we offer a full list of schemas and examples relevant for properties. The properties relevant for each element in the Periodic Table are also listed [separately](periodic-table.md).
