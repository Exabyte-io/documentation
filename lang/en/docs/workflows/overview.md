# Workflows

This section contains information about how we organize, store and apply **workflows** for modeling and simulations.

## [Components](components/overview.md)

We introduce the computational sub-components of workflows, with particular attention to **subworkflows** and **units**, [in this section](components/overview.md). 

## [Data](data/overview.md)

The [Data](data/overview.md) section contains information about the structured data convention used to store workflows and their sub-components, with example JSON representations for each.

## [Templating](templating/overview.md)

**Templating** is an important concept which we apply to automate and generalize the mass-generation of simulation input files. It is described in detail in a [dedicated section](templating/overview.md) of the documentation.

## [Bank](bank.md)

[Workflows Bank](bank.md) collection and its related operations is explained in the corresponding section.

## [Default](default.md)

The default workflow present at the moment of creation of a new account on our platform is introduced [here](default.md).

## User Interface

Specific features pertaining to the Explorer Interface of the Workflows collection are explained [here](ui/explorer.md). Descriptions on [Viewer](ui/viewer.md) and [Designer](../workflow-designer/overview.md) in the context of workflows are also offered.

## [Actions](actions/overview.md)

The [Actions](actions/overview.md) section explains and provides visual examples of actions that users can perform on workflows.
