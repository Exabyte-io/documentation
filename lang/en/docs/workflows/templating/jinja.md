# Template Engines

We introduce in this page the basics of Jinja2 syntax used by templating on our platform. The reader is referred to the official documentations for further information [^1][^2].

## Basic Syntax

The general convention of the syntax [^3]:

- `{% ... %}`: for **Statements**
- `{{ ... }}`: for **Expressions** to print to the template output
- `{# ... #}`: for **Commentaries** not included in the template output

### Variables Assignment

Inside code blocks, the user can also **assign** values to variables using the **"set" statement**, such as in the following example, where `element_name` is the variable name and `"Al"` represents its assigned value.

```jinja
{% set element_name = "Al" %}
```

### Inserting Variables

The following simple example illustrates the basic syntax for inserting variables, based on the use of pairs of curly braces mentioned above.

```jinja
{{name}} has the chemical formula {{formula}}.
```

If `name="Silica"` and `formula="SiO2"`, then the templating engine will generate, or render, the following final output after acting upon the above template input.

```jinja
Silica has the chemical formula SiO2.
```

### Accessing Context Nested Keys

The **bracket notation** is employed for accessing keys from different levels across a nested context. For example, in the case of the nested context shown below, the KPPRA variable would be imported from its parent keyword "kgrid" as shown in the ensuing line.

```jinja
{
    "kgrid": {
        "KPPRA": 32000,
    }
}
```

```jinja
KPPRA =  {{ kgrid["KPPRA"] }}
```

!!! tip "Dot Notation"
    For the template variables rendered at design time one can use Javascript "dot notation" to access a nested key.

    ```jinja
    KPPRA =  {{ kgrid.KPPRA }}
    ```

The input variable definitions and associated values are provided in the **Context** of the template.

## Loops and Conditional Statements

Control structures such as Loops and Conditional Statements can control the flow of the template. Here, we cover conditionals and for-loops by way of examples.

### Conditionals

A basic conditional "if/else" type of statement in Jinja would consist in the following block of statements.

```jinja
{% if truth_value %}
This is true
{% else %}
This is false
{% endif %}
```

If boolean `truth_value` resolves to `true`, then the output of the above template will be `This is true` and vice versa.

### Loops

We now create a template containing a "for" loop, as in the following example.

```jinja
{% for element in elements %}
{{ element }}
{% endfor %}
```

If `elements = ['Bi', 'O', 'Cu']`, then the following output is rendered.

```
    Bi

    O

    Cu
```

## Filters

Template variables can be modified by **filters**. Filters are separated from the variable by a **pipe symbol (|)**, and may have optional arguments passed to them in parentheses. Multiple filters can also be **chained**, meaning that the output of one filter is applied to the next.

Supported Jinja2 **built-in filters** are reviewed in its documentation web-page [^4].
