# Jupyter Lab


JupyterLab [^1] is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter [^2] offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook [^3] in a flexible and powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.

We include support for **Jupyter Lab** within our platform, using the operating system default interpreter version 2.7.5 for Python.

## Data

We introduce the [structured representation](../../../data-structured/overview.md) for Jupyter Lab application [here](data.md).
