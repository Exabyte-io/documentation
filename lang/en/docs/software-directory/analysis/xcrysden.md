# XCrySDen

XCrySDen is a crystalline and molecular structure visualisation program. It is particularly suited for the display of isosurfaces and contours, which can be superimposed on crystalline structures and then interactively rotated and manipulated. XCrySDen allows for real-time capture of display, for which several movie encoders are supported.

Full instructions on how this visualization software can be manipulated can be found in the official website [^1].
