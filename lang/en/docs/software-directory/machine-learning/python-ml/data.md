# Data

This implementation of Machine Learning uses [Python](../../scripting/python/overview.md) under-the-hood. Hence, its
workflow units adopt the [schema](../../../data-structured/overview.md) used
by [Python Units](../../scripting/python/data.md).

```json tab="Schema" 
{!esse/schema/software_directory/scripting/python.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!esse/example/software_directory/scripting/python.json!}
```
