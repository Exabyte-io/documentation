# Exabyte Machine Learning Engine

We provide a proof-of-concept support for [Machine Learning](../../../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md) through the **Exabyte Machine Learning (Exabyte-ML) engine**, which is based upon the [Linear Regression](../../../methods-directory/linear-regression/overview.md) computational and statistical method. 

The currently implemented version of this engine is 0.2.0. 

## Accessibility

Exabyte-ML is accessible via the [subworkflow editor interface](../../../workflow-designer/subworkflow-editor/overview.md). Pre-assembled ML workflows can be imported directly from the [Workflows Bank](../../../workflows/bank.md).
