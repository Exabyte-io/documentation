# Quantum ESPRESSO

Quantum ESPRESSO (QE, also referred to as "espresso" in our platform) [^1] [^2] is a software suite for ab-initio quantum methods performing general electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling. It is distributed for free under the GNU General Public License. Quantum ESPRESSO is based on [Density Functional Theory](../../../models-directory/dft/overview.md), [plane wave basis sets and pseudopotentials](../../../methods-directory/pseudopotential/overview.md) (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft). 

## Supported Versions

We support 5.2.1, 5.4.0, 6.0.0, and 6.3.0 versions of Quantum ESPRESSO.

## [Components](components.md)

We introduce the different [components](../../../software/components.md) which are part of the Quantum ESPRESSO software distribution [in this page](components.md).

## [Compute Parameters](compute-parameters.md)

We explain which [compute parameters](../../../infrastructure/compute/parameters.md) are specific to Quantum ESPRESSO [here](compute-parameters.md).

## [Data](data.md)

The [structured representation](../../../data-structured/overview.md) for Quantum ESPRESSO, and for its specific compute parameters, is explained [in this page](data.md).
