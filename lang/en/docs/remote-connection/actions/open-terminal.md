# Open / Close Web Terminal

The [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) remote connection method for accessing the [Command Line Interface](../../cli/overview.md) of our platform is accessible by clicking on the "Remote Access" icon in the top right corner of the platform [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md) (just left of your account logo) and selecting `Terminal` option.

The Web Terminal can subsequently be closed by clicking the ✕ button at its top-right corner, which reverts the entire screen to its previous appearance.
