# Access Data in Web Interface with Dropbox

Among its other functions, the [Dropbox](../../data-in-objectstorage/dropbox.md) folder allows the user to exchange data back and forth between the [Remote Desktop](../remote-desktop.md) or [Web Terminal](../web-terminal.md) remote connection methods, and the main [Web Interface](../../ui/overview.md) of our platform.

## Animation

In the animation below, we show how to transfer (copy) files to Dropbox within the Remote Desktop, and later retrieve them inside the Web Interface under the [Dropbox dedicated page](../../data-in-objectstorage/ui/dropbox-page.md).
