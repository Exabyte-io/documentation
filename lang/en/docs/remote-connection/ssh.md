# Command Line Interface via SSH

Users can connect to the [Command Line Interface](../cli/overview.md) (CLI)
of our platform using an **SSH terminal client** under any Operating System
(OS), as an alternative to the [Web Terminal](web-terminal.md).

We use **SSH keys** [^1] to identify users and trusted computers during command
line sessions. Keys provide improved security, but they must be properly set up
before use. The steps on this page will guide you through generating SSH keys
and adding them to your account.

Experienced users who are already familiar with how SSH clients operate under
their preferred Operating System can navigate directly to the
[Upload SSH key](#upload-ssh-key) section below.

## SSH Client

Make sure you have a SSH client installed in your computer. We particularly
recommend the following SSH clients.

- **OpenSSH**[^2]: the standard protocol in Unix-based OSs (both Linux and
macOS distributions) for connecting through SSH via the terminal. <br/>Starting
from Windows version 10, OpenSSH client is included as a Windows Feature. Please
expand below section if OpenSSH is not enabled on your Windows computer. Once
enabled, both `ssh` and `scp` commands should be available via both
**PowerShell** and **Command Prompt**.

    1. Click on the Windows **Start menu** and search for **Apps and Features**.
    Click on **Apps and Features** on the sidebar, then click **Optional
    Features**.
    ![Windows 10 Apps and Features](../images/remote-connection/win10apps.webp)
    2. Scroll down the list to check if **OpenSSH Client** is listed. Otherwise,
    click the plus sign next to **Add a feature**, select **OpenSSH Client**,
    and click **Install**.

    </details>

- **Putty**[^3]: a widespread SSH client for Windows users, can be used as an
alternative to OpenSSH.

## Generate SSH Keys

As introduced previously, SSH keys are necessary to connect to the CLI using the
credentials for the account under consideration. You can create a RSA key of
size 4096 bits with the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"
```
where `-C` flag refers to comment, which could be any identifier. You will be
prompted to specify a file to save the key. Press Enter to accept the default
location. When prompted, enter a secure passphrase for your key. This step is
optional but recommended for added security. After keys are generated, there
will be two files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`. Please upload the public key file
`id_rsa.pub` as described below.

Please refer to the external tutorials on the advanced usage of OpenSSH [^4] and
Putty [^5] clients.

## Upload SSH Key

After generating the keys, the public key need to be uploaded to our platform
and associated with the user's account. This effectively establishes a
**secure link** between the external SSH client and the corresponding Mat3ra
account.

We explain how to upload the SSH keys to our platform in a
[separate section](../accounts/ui/preferences/ssh.md) of the documentation.

!!!warning "Privacy of SSH keys"
    SSH keys are **private** and are meant to be used to identify exclusively
    the user with our platform. Any other user logged in with such private keys
    would automatically have access to the account's data and allocation, and
    because of this they should not be shared with anyone else.

## Connecting to Mat3ra Server

Once the secure SSH link is established via the SSH keys, the remote Mat3ra
server can be accessed as follows (the user should replace the text inside
braces below with the corresponding names/paths).

!!!info "Name of remote server"
    Our Mat3ra server for accepting remote connections is referred to under the
    alias of **"bohr"**, and is accessible via the corresponding address
    `login.mat3ra.com`.

### SSH using OpenSSH

1. The user should first change the permissions on the private key to be
accessible to him/her only.

    ```
    chmod 400 {path/to/your/private_key}
    ```

2. At the command prompt, the user should then enter the following command.

    ```
    ssh -i {path/to/your/private_key} {mat3ra.com_username}@login.mat3ra.com
    ```

### Putty for Windows

Instructions on how to operate Putty to connect to our remote server can be
found in Ref. [^6]. The name of the server to be used in this case is the same
as before, namely `login.mat3ra.com`.

### Enter the CLI

Following successful SSH connection, the user is presented with the
[CLI of our platform](../cli/overview.md).

Some useful instructions are already contained in the CLI
**splash welcome screen** greeting the user at the moment of login. A copy of
this welcome screen is reproduced below.

![CLI Welcome Screen](../images/remote-connection/CLI-Welcome-Screen.png  "CLI Welcome Screen")

## Transfer Files with SCP

The user can also transfer files back and forth from his/her local hard drives
to the folders on the remote Exabyte server. For this purpose, we recommend the
**SCP file transfer protocol** [^7], which is also based on SSH. Detailed
instructions on how to transfer files using `scp` is available
[in a separate page](actions/transfer-files-scp.md).

### Windows Instructions

Once OpenSSH client is enabled on [Windows](#ssh-client),
[scp](#transfer-files-with-scp) command should be available via Windows
**PowerShell** and **Command Prompt** terminals.

Alternatively, you may use **WinSCP** graphical user interface program [^8]. A
tutorial demonstrating how to operate it can be retrieved in Ref. [^9].

When using WinSCP, one would need to load the private key through its interface
before connecting. Explanations on how to do so can be found in Ref. [^10].
