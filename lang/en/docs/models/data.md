The example of a JSON data structure for a model, based upon the **[Exabyte Data Convention](../data-structured/overview.md)**, is shown below together with an associated example.

The corresponding method components are also included in this example, and are explained further [in this section](../methods/overview.md) of the documentation.

    ``` json
    --8<-- "data/esse/schema/model.json"
    ```
