# User Interface Components

There are two types of UI components: (1) global components that are present in
each and every page, and (2) page specific components that appear or change
according to the page context and functionality.


## Global Components

Below is the screenshot of the Exabyte platform homepage, expanded left-hand
sidebar, and Account menu opened. There are three global UI components in the
Mat3ra web interface:

1. [header and footer areas](header-footer.md)
2. [left-hand sidebar](left-sidebar.md)
3. [account menu](account-menu.md).

## Page Specific Components

Other general user interface components are instead accessible only from
specific locations, such as the Navigation Tab bar, which is present in the
Materials, Workflows, and Jobs pages.

### 1. [Link to Homepage Navigation](specific/homepage.md)

The Navigation page is accessible through our company logo present at all times
in the top [header bar](header-footer.md). [This page](specific/homepage.md)
explains how to use Navigation to make the initial general choices on the nature
of the computations to be performed on our platform.

### 2. [Link to Dashboard](specific/dashboard.md)

A system status "Dashboard" can be accessed via the [left-hand sidebar menu](
left-sidebar.md). It is explained in more detail in [this page](
specific/dashboard.md).

### 3. [Tabs Navigation](specific/tabs-navigator.md)

Numerous pages on our platform, and most notably the [Account Profile](
../accounts/ui/profile-page.md) page, contain a series of Tabs for ease of
navigation within the page. Such Tabs are reviewed [here](
specific/tabs-navigator.md).
