# Authentication in JupyterLite

## Overview

When working with JupyterLite notebooks that interact with the Mat3ra platform API, you need to authenticate to access your account data, materials, and computational resources. The authentication method depends on how you're accessing JupyterLite.

## Authentication Methods

### 1. JupyterLite from Platform

When you launch JupyterLite from the Platform using the JupyterLite Session, authentication happens automatically. The platform passes your credentials through the `data_from_host` variable, which includes:

- Account ID
- Authentication token
- Organization ID
- Available clusters

No additional authentication steps are required in this mode.

### 2. Standalone Notebooks

When running notebooks outside the Platform (e.g., local IDE, jupyterlite.mat3ra.com), you will be authenticated using the OIDC (OpenID Connect) device flow.

## OIDC Device Flow Authentication

### Step-by-Step Authentication Process

#### Step 1: Run Authentication Code

In your notebook, import and run the authentication function:

```python
from utils.auth import authenticate

await authenticate()
```

The process of authentication in JupyterLite notebook:

#### Step 2: View User Code in Notebook

The notebook will display an "Authentication Required" message with a unique user code:

![Authentication Code in Notebook](../images/jupyterlite/auth-notebook-code.webp "User code displayed in notebook")

The code (e.g., "RTJW-LJDN") is displayed prominently. Keep this visible as you'll need to verify it in the browser.

#### Step 3: Browser Opens Automatically

A new browser window or tab will open automatically, taking you to the Mat3ra authentication page:

![Device Confirmation Page](../images/jupyterlite/auth-browser-confirm.webp "Browser confirmation page")

This page shows:
- The application requesting access ("Mat3ra CLI Device Flow")
- Your account information
- The permissions being requested
- Options to CANCEL or CONFIRM

#### Step 4: Sign In (If Needed)

If you're not already signed in, you'll see a sign-in page:

![Sign In Page](../images/jupyterlite/auth-browser-signin.webp "Sign in confirmation")

Confirm that you want to sign in to Mat3ra CLI Device Flow with your account.

#### Step 5: Confirm Device

Click the **CONFIRM** button to authorize the notebook to access your account.

#### Step 6: Success Confirmation

After confirming, you'll see a success message:

![Authentication Success](../images/jupyterlite/auth-success.webp "Authentication successful")

You can now close this browser window and return to your notebook.

#### Step 7: Continue in Notebook

Back in your notebook, the authentication process completes automatically. Your access tokens are now stored in environment variables, and you can proceed with API calls.

### Complete Code Example

Here's a complete example showing authentication and basic API usage:

```python
# 1. Authenticate
from utils.auth import authenticate
await authenticate()

# 2. Initialize API client
from mat3ra.api_client import APIClient
client = APIClient.authenticate()

# 3. Use the API
projects = client.projects.list({"isDefault": True})
print(f"Found {len(projects)} project(s)")
```


## Troubleshooting

### Browser Window Doesn't Open

If the browser window doesn't open automatically:

1. Check if popup blockers are preventing the window from opening
2. Look for the verification URL in the notebook output
3. Manually copy and paste the URL into your browser

### "Authorization Pending" Message

If the notebook keeps showing "authorization pending":

1. Make sure you clicked CONFIRM in the browser
2. Check that you're signed in to the correct account
3. Verify the user code matches between notebook and browser


## Technical Details

### Token Storage

Authentication tokens are stored in environment variables:

- `OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Used for API requests
- `OIDC_REFRESH_TOKEN`: Used to obtain new access tokens when they expire

These tokens persist for the duration of your notebook session but are not saved to disk.

### Security Considerations

- Tokens are session-specific and expire after a period of inactivity
- Never share your authentication tokens or commit them to version control
- Always authenticate in a secure environment
- The device flow ensures your password is never exposed to the notebook

### Token Expiration

Access tokens expire after 30 minutes. In that case, you need to restart the kernel and Run All Cells again (save and use ids for materials, jobs or other entities to avoid losing references). 

Or adjust the `authenticate` function to force re-authentication upon re-running of that cell:

```python
await authenticate(force=True)
```


### API Client Configuration

The authentication process automatically configures the API client with:

- Base URL for the Mat3ra API
- OIDC endpoint URLs
- Client ID and scope
- Token refresh mechanism
