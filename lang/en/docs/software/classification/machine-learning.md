# Machine Learning

[Machine learning](../../models-directory/machine-learning/overview.md) relates to algorithms and statistical models that computers can use to progressively improve with time their performance in solving certain problems. 

## Implementation

We have a proof-of-concept support for Machine Learning within our platform as a way to do predictive modeling of materials, as mentioned [in this section](../../software-directory/overview.md#machine-learning) of the documentation.

We also now support the use of [TensorFlow](/software-directory/machine-learning/tensorflow) and 
[TensorMol](/software-directory/machine-learning/tensormol)
