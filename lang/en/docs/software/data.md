# Structured Representations

We provide below examples of JSON-based structured representation for an application, and for each of its possible [components](overview.md#applications) (executables and flavors) and [classification categories](classification/overview.md). This structured representation is based upon the [Exabyte Data Convention](../data-structured/overview.md) implemented throughout our platform. 

!!! note "Work in progress"
    Some applications are yet to be fully integrated into our platform to have a structured representation. These are only available via [Command Line Interface](../cli/overview.md).

## [Application](components.md)

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/software/application.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!example/software/application.json!}
```

## [Executable](components.md#executables)

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/software/executable.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!example/software/executable.json!}
```

## [Flavor](components.md#flavors)

```json tab="Schema" 
{!schema/software/flavor.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!example/software/flavor.json!}
```
