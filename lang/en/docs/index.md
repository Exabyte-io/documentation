# Mat3ra Documentation

[**Mat3ra**](https://platform.mat3ra.com) is a cloud-native accessible and collaborative platform for materials modeling from the atomic scale. Our platform makes it easier for scientists, engineers, and researchers to **design new materials** and **predict their properties** using *first-principles* calculation. Such an approach does not require any knowledge of experimental observations, instead solely takes into account the atomistic description of material (e.g., constituent atoms, crystal structure, lattice constant, etc.) to compute desired properties thanks to [Density Functional Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory){:target='_blank'} and its numerical implementations. Our platform also helps users collaborate, share and gather obtained knowledge with others on the platform. This documentation explains how the platform works in detail.


## Quick start

You can skip straight to our tutorial summarizing [first steps](getting-started/run-first-simulation/web-interface.md). There you will learn how to set up and run [density functional theory](models-directory/dft/overview.md) calculation to obtain [electronic band structure](properties-directory/non-scalar/bandstructure.md) of silicon, a semiconducting material widely used in making electronic chips.
