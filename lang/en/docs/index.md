Mat3ra.com offers a comprehensive high-performance computing (HPC) solution in
the cloud with a special focus on materials simulation for both academia and
industry. We offer an intuitive web interface for designing new materials,
managing workflows, running simulations, and organizing results and data in a
more collaborative, accessible, and efficient way.

Certainly, the command line interface (CLI) will remain a powerful choice among
the advanced HPC users, so not only do we offer SSH connection to our platform,
but we also offer a web terminal feature that can be used from any web browser
on any device without the need for an SSH client or terminal application.

Finally, we offer API access to our platform that allows integrating our
platform features with other tools and applications, including access from
within the Python Jupyter Notebook, a popular tool among data scientists and
machine learning engineers.

We are here to be part of your journey to accelerate your R&D on materials
design and discovery in the AI/ML era. This documentation explains how you can
use our platform to design new materials and simulate their properties using
physics-based and AI/ML models powered by cloud HPC.
