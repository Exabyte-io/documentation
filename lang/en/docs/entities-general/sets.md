# Entity Sets

Some Entities (Materials and Jobs) can each be grouped together into "Sets" to organize them better. Sets therefore play a similar same role as **folders** in an operating system environment, for example.

There are two types of sets, **unordered** and **ordered**. As the names imply, an **unordered** set contains entities without any order and may contain nested sets. The sets are created **unordered** by default. On the other hand an **ordered** set includes one-level set of entities with a specific order.

## Change Type

The type of entity set can be changed following [these instructions](actions/change-set-type.md).

## Change Order

The order of entities inside an ordered set can be adjusted following [these instructions](actions/set-entity-index.md).

## Inspect Contents
 
Following the [creation](actions/create-sets.md) of a new Set, the user can [open it](actions/open-edit.md) to inspect its contents. 

## Move Contents

Entities (and other Sets as well) can be moved to Sets following [these instructions](actions/move-to-sets.md).

## Nested Structure

New sub-sets can be created inside a parent Set. Iterating this operation results in a nested directory structure.
