# Import Entities from Bank

In order to import Entities from their respective [Banks](../bank.md) into the Account-owned [collections](../../accounts/collections.md), the following general procedure should be followed.

## Open Bank Page

First click on the corresponding `Bank` option in the [left-hand Sidebar](../../ui/left-sidebar.md) and choose either Materials or Workflows.

## Search for Entity

The list of banked entities can be searched with the help of the [search text bar](../../entities-general/actions/search.md) <i class="zmdi zmdi-search zmdi-hc-border"></i> located at the top of the Bank page.

## Execute Copy Action

Next, [select](select.md) the desired entries and click `Copy` <i class="zmdi zmdi-copy zmdi-hc-border"></i> button in the top-right [actions toolbar](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-toolbar).

## Links

Entity-specific explanations of the above procedure are available for [Materials](../../materials/bank.md) and [Workflows](../../workflows/bank.md) respectively.
