# Exabyte Data Convention

Our approach towards storing and organizing structured data is based on the **Exabyte Data Convention (EDC)** explained in the present documentation. We use this convention to store and organize the information associated with the [Entities](../entities-general/overview.md) present across our platform, and their corresponding [Accounts](../accounts/overview.md) and [Permissions](../entities-general/permissions.md). The convention is designed with the aim of facilitating both the access and collaboration with regards to such entities. The fundamental practices are further elucidated in the sections below. 

## JSON Representation

We make use of the **JSON format** [^1] [^2] for storing **structured data** . This structured data might for example be relevant for storing information about the [entities](../entities-general/data.md) present in the [account-owned collections](../accounts/collections.md), and for storing their respective [properties](../properties/data/overview.md).

### Example

Data included in the expandable section below shows an example **JSON representation** of a material sample of silicon and is presented to demonstrate the concept. The explanation of the keywords specific to [Material](../materials/overview.md) entity can be found [here](../materials/data.md).

## JSON Schemas

In computer science, a schema [^3] is a general concept referring to how structured data can be **stored** and **organized** within a database. **JSON schemas** [^4] [^5] in particular consist in a vocabulary that allows to **validate** JSON-based documents containing structured data, and to annotate them with **descriptions**. 

## Examples

Multiple **schemas** are deployed on our platform in order to describe the data. The reader is referred to the specific pages associated with the different [entities](../entities-general/data.md) and their respective [Properties](../properties/data/overview.md).
