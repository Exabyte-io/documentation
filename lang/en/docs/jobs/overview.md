# Jobs

In this section we review the concept of computational "Jobs", which consist in
the application of a [Workflow](../workflows/overview.md) (or simulation) on a
[Material](../materials/overview.md) to produce one or more [Properties](
../properties/overview.md).

Job is a "container" entity that is used to organize the data and track resource
allocation. The terminology and naming is commonly used for distributed resource
allocation management. A job, in the computational sense, represents the
simplest entity that has accounting set up for, and can have one or more
[Material](../materials/overview.md) and a single [Workflow](
../workflows/overview.md) associated with it.

We implement Jobs as another [entity type](../entities-general/overview.md). As
such, they have the same user interface components (with some distinct features)
as other entities, as explained [here](../entities-general/ui/overview.md).

## [Data](data.md)

The data convention applied for Jobs including, for example, their database
representation is explained [in this page](data.md).

## [Status](status.md)

Jobs have different statuses attributed to them depending on the level of
progress of the simulation. We explain the list of possible statuses [here](
status.md).

## [Projects](projects.md)

Jobs can collectively be grouped together into [Sets](
../entities-general/sets.md), which in this context are referred to as
**[Projects](projects.md)**.

## User Interface

### [Explorer](ui/explorer.md)

Jobs Explorer is another specific implementation of the [Explorer](
../entities-general/ui/explorer.md) component and is explained [in this page](
ui/explorer.md).

### [Designer](../jobs-designer/overview.md)

Jobs Designer is another specific implementation of the [Designer](
../entities-general/ui/designer.md) component described in more detail [here](
../jobs-designer/overview.md).

### [Viewer](ui/viewer.md)

[This page](ui/viewer.md) explains how the [Viewer](
../entities-general/ui/viewer.md) differs from Designer component in the context
of Jobs.

## [Actions](actions/overview.md)

Some actions pertain specifically to Jobs, and are introduced [in this page](
actions/overview.md).

Below we present a short video demonstrating how to create jobs in Mat3ra
platform.
