# JupyterLite Session Dialog

The JupyterLite Session dialog allows you to interact with the JupyterLite environment, which is a lightweight implementation of JupyterLab that runs entirely in the browser. This dialog is accessible via the ["Advanced" menu](../advanced.md) > JupyterLite Transformation within the Materials Designer interface.
