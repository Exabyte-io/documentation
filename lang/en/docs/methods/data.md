# Structured Representation of Methods

In order to organize and store the information about [Methods](overview.md) on our platform, we employ the **Exabyte Data Convention**, as explained [elsewhere](../data-structured/overview.md) in the documentation.

Below, the user can find an example JSON structured representation of a [Method](overview.md). 

```json tab="Schema" 
{!esse/schema/method.json!}
```

```json tab="Example" 
{!esse/example/method.json!}
```
