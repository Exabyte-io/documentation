# Default Pseudopotentials


## UPF

### Ultra-soft

Our platform provides the GBRV [^1] pseudopotential set at version 1.5 by default for the applications supporting the unified pseudopotential format (UPF).

### Norm-conserving

We make use of the "pseudo-dojo" repository of norm-conserving pseudopotentials and use its scalar relativistic stringent subset at version 0.4 [^3].

### VASP

For [VASP](../../software-directory/modeling/vasp/overview.md) we provide the sets of `paw` pseudopotential for each supported version.
