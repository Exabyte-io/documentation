The File Content property allows users to mark specific files for display at the end of a job.

## Example

In the below example, a user has generated a [parity plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_plot) and has named it
`my_parity_plot.png`. The File Content property was then configured to display an image named `my_parity_plot.png`.
Below, this can be observed in the results tab of the job.

![Parity_Plot](../../images/properties-directory/file_content.png "Parity plot generated via ML")

The JSON schema and an example implementation can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#file-content)
