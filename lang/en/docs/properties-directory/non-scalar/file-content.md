# File Content

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Non-Scalar</span>

The File Content property allows users to mark specific files for display at the end of a job.

## Example

In the below example, a user has generated a parity plot [^1] and has named it
`my_parity_plot.png`. The File Content property was then configured to display an image named `my_parity_plot.png`.
Below, this can be observed in the results tab of the job.

![Parity_Plot](../../images/properties-directory/file_content.png "Parity plot generated via ML")

## Schema

The JSON schema and an example implementation can be found [here](../../properties/data/list.md#file-content)
