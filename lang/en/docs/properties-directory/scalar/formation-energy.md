# Formation Energy

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Thermodynamic</span>

The formation energy represents the energetic cost of creating a **defect** into an otherwise perfect solid structure. For example, for the case of a vacancy defect, it is calculated as the energy needed to remove the corresponding atom from the bulk. 

Below is the formula used to calculate formation energy:	
 
$$
 E_fmt = E_tot (compound) - \sum{all elements} \sum{all atoms for element} (E_zpe + E_tot)
$$	
 
 `E_fmt` and `E_tot`, `E_zpe` are the formation energy, total energy and zero point energy for the compound and lowest energy elemental structures, correspondingly.

    The calculation of Formation energies is not yet available as a Workflow computation on our platform.
