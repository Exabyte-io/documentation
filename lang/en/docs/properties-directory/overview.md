# List of Properties

In this section of the documentation, we review in detail the physical relevance and description of each [property](../properties/overview.md) available for computation. 

In each case, we also explain how such results are presented to the user under the interface of the [Results Tab](../jobs/ui/results-tab.md) within [Jobs Viewer](../jobs/ui/viewer.md), when results are extracted from the output of simulations. 

Illustrations of the [JSON schemas](../properties/data/overview.md) and associated examples for each property discussed in the present section are contained [in this page](../properties/data/list.md), and referenced at the end of each property's dedicated description.

At the top of each property's page, we include colored badges referring to the [property classification](../properties/classification/overview.md), distinguishing between [scalar and non-scalar](../properties/classification#by-data-type) types and between the different types of [Materials Properties](../properties/classification/materials.md).
