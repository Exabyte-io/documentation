# InChIKey

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Non-Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Structural</span>

The International Chemical Identifier Key (InChIKey) of a material is derived from the [InChI](inchi.md). It is a 27 character non-human readable condensed digital representation of the InChI, also known as a hash.[^1]

## Notation
The InChIKey is a 14-8-1 character string. The first 14 characters represent the connectivity and charge information. The next 8 character represent the remaining sublayer information. The final character represents the kind of InChIKey being generated, including the version of InChI used.

The 14-8-1 Character string is represented as follows:

```
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-YYYYYYYYFV-P
```
