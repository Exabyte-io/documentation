# Molecular Weight

<span class="btn badge b-success border-50">Non-Scalar</span> <span class="btn badge b-info border-50">Structural</span>

All [Non-Periodic](../../materials/classification/non-periodic.md) structures have a molecular weight(MW)[^1] (also known as molecular mass) associated with them that is based on the total sum of weight of all atoms that make up the structure.
The units for MW are in terms of grams (g) per mole (mol). A mole is a standard unit of measurement in chemistry for measuring atoms and molecules.[^2]

For example, H<sub>2</sub>O has a MW of 18.001 g/mol. This is calculated by summing together the molecular weight of Oxygen and 2x the molecular weight of Hydrogen.

MW Oxygen = 15.999 g/mol

MW Hydrogren = 1.001 g/mol

MW H<sub>2</sub>O = 15.999 g/mol + 1.001 g/mol 1.001 g/mol = 18.001 g/mol.
