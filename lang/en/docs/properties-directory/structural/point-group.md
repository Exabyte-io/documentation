In geometry, point groups [^1] represent a description of the **symmetry** of the geometry when one point is kept fixed in space. Point groups can be used to describe the symmetry of a molecular structure.[^2] Generally the symmetry of a molecular structure can be used to categorize molecules due to the point groups ability to predict and explain a molecules chemical properties.

There are 31 common point groups that tend to be applied to molecules.[^2] For example, benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) is categorized as D<sub>6h</sub> as it has a 6-fold symmetry around the center of the structure. 
Five types of symmetry elements are used to classify the a molecule by its point group:
1. Symmetry Axis: An axis around which a rotation by 360<sup>o</sup>/n results in an indistinguishable structure from the original.
2. Plane of Symmetry: A plane of reflection which generates an identical copy of the original. 
3. Inversion Center: Idential atoms exist at points (x, y, z) and (-x, -y, -z) when the molecule is plotted in 3-dimensional space.
4. Rotation-reflection Axis: An axis in which a rotation by 360<sup>o</sup>/n, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to the axis results in an indistinguishable copy of the original.
5. Identity: No change in the structure results in the same structure. This operation is the equivalent of multiplying the coordinates of the structure by 1 (unity).

## Notation

Point Groups are labelled using Schoenflies notation[^3], and examples include D<sub>6h</sub>, C<sub>2v</sub>, and T<sub>d</sub>.
