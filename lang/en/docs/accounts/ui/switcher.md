# Account Switcher

The possibility to switch between all Accounts available for login to the user
is offered at the top of the [right-hand menu sidebar](
../../ui/account-menu.md), under the label `My Accounts`
<i class="zmdi zmdi-globe-alt zmdi-hc-border"></i>.

## Currently Logged-in Account

The name and type of the account that the user is currently logged into is
displayed in [header](../../ui/header-footer.md).

## View My Accounts

If the user is a member of, an [organization](
../../collaboration/organizations/overview.md), the "My Accounts" list will
contain other accounts, besides his/her personal one. This list is presented
using an [Explorer-type interface](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md), with
its associated layout and features.

## Switch to Account

The user is able to switch between the personal account and organizational
accounts by clicking on their corresponding names in the list. When switched,
the interface will consequently reflect the change by showing the data related
specifically to the organizational account, for example storage quota and
balance affecting the wider organization as opposed to the user's personal
consumption.

## Example

In the image below, three accounts are listed in the Account Switcher: a
personal account labelled "John Doe", and two organizational accounts called
"Seminar Organization" and "Mat3ra Org". The account under which the user is
currently logged in is the "Seminar Organization".
