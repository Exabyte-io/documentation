# Accounts

The concept of "Account" within the context of our platform broadly refers to the multiple different ways in which a user can engage in **actions** on the [entities](../entities-general/overview.md), such as [creating](../entities-general/actions/create.md) [Materials](../materials/overview.md) or [running](../jobs/actions/run.md) [Jobs](../jobs/overview.md) or collaborating with other users by [sharing](../collaboration/sharing/actions.md) entities with them. 

> For the explanation of how the term "User" is compared with the more general concept of "Account", please refer to the [following page](users.md).

## [Account Entities](collections.md)

Accounts perform actions on the Entities stored in the corresponding collections as explained in the [corresponding page](collections.md).

## [Types of Accounts](ui/switcher.md)

It is important for the present discussion to draw a distinction between two different types of accounts: **Individual** accounts for users, and collaborative accounts with a membership comprising multiple users, referred to as **Organizational** or **Enterprise** (the two words are used interchangeably). The User can choose which account to use among all the available options through the Account Switcher, described [here](ui/switcher.md).

### Individual Accounts

Every user of our platform is associated with an Individual Account created at the moment of registration. The User is, by definition, always the sole member of their individual account and also the owner and administrator thereof. We sometimes also refer to these accounts as "Personal" accounts too.

### [Organizations](../collaboration/organizations/overview.md)

The concept of Organization, or collaborative account, is the object of a separate explanation in [its dedicated page](../collaboration/organizations/overview.md).

## [Service Levels](service-levels.md)

The quality of service for the account, including features such as private data, pricing and quotas are defined by the account's [service level](service-levels.md).

## [Balance](balance.md)

Account [Balance](balance.md) allows to perform actions that require monetary exchange.

## [User Interface](ui/overview.md)

Accounts can be manipulated, navigated, and defined according to certain settings or descriptions through the corresponding interface, introduced [here](ui/overview.md).

## [Accounting Actions](accounting/overview.md)

Each User can perform a certain set of Actions in relation to the Account that he/she is currently logged into, and these are narrated starting from [this page](accounting/overview.md).
