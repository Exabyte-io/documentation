## Types

For the [personal accounts](overview.md#personal-accounts) we offer "Free" and "Pro" service levels. For the [organizational accounts](overview.md#personal-accounts) we offer "Free", "Team" and "Enterprise" levels. The "Free" service level is designed as a temporary way for the users to try and understand the operations of our platform. For the detailed comparison of the pricing associated with different Service Levels offered as part of our platform, the user is referred to the [pricing documentation page](../pricing/service-levels.md). 

## View/Change Service Level

All the relevant information concerning Service Levels, under the context of the currently selected Account, can be inspected through the corresponding [component of the User Interface](ui/service-level.md). It is important to bear in mind that, when dealing with collaborative accounts, only the Owner or an Administrator of the account is given the rights to undergo such operations on behalf of the whole Organization. 

## Validity Period

All service levels except "Free" tier are associated with a validity period within which the product is accessible to an account.
Any **unused computational balance** at the end of the current validity period will be available (roll-over) into the next validity period, following a service level renewal. Otherwise the account's service level is reverted back to "Free" tier within 30 business days and the balance is nullified.

## Old Service Levels

Old service levels are migrated into new scheme with features and pricing preserved. 
When the service level expires, the features and pricing will be automatically reverted back to the new one.
