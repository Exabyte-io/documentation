# Service Levels

> Updated service levels scheme as of July 2019. For the information about the legacy service levels scheme please contact our support team.

Service levels define the types, qualities and quantities of services provided to the accounts within our platform. The features available on our platform are affected by the opted Service Level. For the detailed comparison of the pricing associated with different Service Levels offered as part of our platform, the user is referred to the [pricing documentation page](../pricing/service-levels.md).

### Free Service Level
 
 The "Free" service level is designed as a temporary way for the users to try and understand the operations of our platform. It provides access to a subset of the platform resources on a limited basis free of charge.

## View/Change Service Level

All the relevant information concerning Service Levels, under the context of the currently selected Account, can be inspected through the corresponding [component of the User Interface](ui/service-level.md). It is important to bear in mind that, when dealing with collaborative accounts, only the Owner or an Administrator of the account is given the rights to undergo such operations on behalf of the whole Organization. 

## Validity Period

Service levels are associated with a validity period within which the product is accessible to an account.
Any unused balance at the end of the current validity period will be available (roll-over) during the next validity period, following a service level renewal. Alternatively, the account's service level is downgraded to "Free" tier within 30 business days and the balance is nullified.

!!!note "Legacy Service Levels"

Legacy service levels (used before July 2019) are migrated into new scheme with features and pricing preserved. When the service level expires, the features and pricing will be converted to the new scheme.
