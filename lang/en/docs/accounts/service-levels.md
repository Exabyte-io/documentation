## Types

For the [personal accounts](overview.md#personal-accounts) we offer "Free" and "Pro" service levels. For the [organizational accounts](overview.md#personal-accounts) we offer "Free", "Team" and "Enterprise" levels. The "Free" service level is designed as a temporary promotional way for the users to understand the operations of our platform. For the detailed comparison of the pricing associated with different Service Levels offered as part of our platform, the user is referred to the [pricing documentation page](../pricing/service-levels.md). 

## View/Change Service Level

All the relevant information concerning Service Levels, under the context of the currently selected Account, can be inspected through the corresponding [component of the User Interface](ui/service-level.md). It is important to bear in mind that, when dealing with collaborative accounts, only the Owner or an Administrator of the account is given the rights to undergo such operations on behalf of the whole Organization. 

## Validity Period

Our users only pay for what they use, however we provide access to the product within a designated period of time - validity period. Any **Unused credits** at the end of the current validity period will be available (roll-over) into the next validity period, following another payment. 

Any credits unused at end of a subscription period will roll over to any contiguous subsequent subscription, but for not more than one additional year. Credits are assumed to be consumed in the order purchased. Rollover credits do not contribute to the prepayment threshold for the renewal period.
