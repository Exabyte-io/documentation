### Free Service Level
 
 The "Free" service level is designed as a temporary way for the users to try and understand the operations of our platform. It provides access to a subset of the platform resources on a limited basis, free of charge.

## View/Change Service Level

All the relevant information concerning Service Levels, under the context of the currently selected Account, can be inspected through the corresponding [component of the User Interface](ui/service-level.md). It is important to bear in mind that, when dealing with collaborative accounts, only the Owner or an Administrator of the account is given the right to undergo such operations on behalf of the whole Organization. 

## Validity Period

Service levels are associated with a validity period within which the product is accessible to an account.
Any unused balance at the end of the current validity period will be available (roll-over) during the next validity period following a service level renewal. Alternatively, the account's service level is downgraded to the "Free" tier within 30 business days, and the balance is nullified.
