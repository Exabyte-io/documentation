## Limited Free Compute for the Platform Users.

!!!note "The Limited Free Compute Program starting in 2025."
The Limited Free Compute Program is starting in 2025. Users are still welcome to submit their information.

The program is targeted for users with current academic affiliations, however, we will consider private parties as well.
Anyone can participate. For the selected users, we will provide computational resources free of charge on a case-by-case
basis.

### Applying for Limited Free Compute

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgghQdRn8sBKespFk3FZSiEoTUmtR0cLhDn0d_rNmtcA-gZg/viewform?usp=dialog
As below:

1. Fill
   in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgghQdRn8sBKespFk3FZSiEoTUmtR0cLhDn0d_rNmtcA-gZg/viewform?usp=dialog" target="_blank">
   this online form</a>
2. For new users - submit a registration request using an email address associated with your academic institution
   include the information requested in **3**.
3. For existing users - if you use a personal email address during the registration, send an email to "
   support@mat3ra.com" from the email address associated with your academic institution (ie. hosted on a ".edu" domain)
   with a subject containing "Free Access for Academic Users"

we will review and enable access as appropriate. We will prioritize applications providing detailed information about
the applicants (ie. Google Scholar, ResearchGate profile(s), links to prior publications) and the nature of the
anticipated work.

### Conditions

Free access is limited to certain compute resources only and is subject to other limitations as below. We will consider
adjusting the limitations according to the user feedback received. Contact "support@mat3ra.com" for this.

#### Limitations

To be specified later. Similar to the below:

|         Feature         |    Explanation     |
|:-----------------------:|:------------------:|
|    Max nodes per job    |         1          |
|    Max cores per job    |         4          |
|    Max job walltime     |      24 hours      |
| Max job queued per user |         4          |
|    Available Queues     |      "D" only      |
|   Available Resources   | "cluster-101" only |
|   Included Disk Quota   |       10 Gb        |
