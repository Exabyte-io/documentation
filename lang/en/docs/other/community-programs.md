# VASP On-demand

From Oct 2017 we are conducting an experimental program for academic users of VASP. Exabyte.io users that hold up-to-date license for VASP can access the software free of charge. In return, we would like to make results available in a form of a case study after the program ends.

> Without any promise, we may consider advocating for the interested people with a well formulated intent for accessing VASP who do not fit the current eligibility criteria in front of the original developers.

**In order to apply**:

- send an email to support@exabyte.io with a subject containing "VASP-On-demand"
- include the following information about yourself:
    - Full name
    - Institutional Affiliation
    - Contact information of the VASP license holder: email, license number
    - Title of the proposed project (200 characters max)
    - Importance of the proposed project (2000 characters max)
    - Execution plan, including approximate amount of computing required (2000 characters max)
    - Whether you are interested in purchasing on-demand per core-hour access to VASP in the future
