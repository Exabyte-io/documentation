## 1. Free Compute Tier for the Platform Users.

In collaboration with our cloud provider partners, we are offering a Limited Free Compute program for our platform
users.

The primary goal of this program is to support academic research and education in the field of materials science and
enable the community to explore the capabilities of our platform.

The program is targeted for users with current academic affiliations, however, we welcome private parties as well.

The free tier access is available through [cluster-101](../infrastructure/clusters/cluster-101.md) only.

### 1.1. Free Compute Eligibility.

To be eligible for the Limited Free Compute program, users must meet the following criteria:

- Be a registered user of the platform.
- Have a valid academic affiliation (eg. student, faculty, researcher) or be a private party interested in exploring the
  platform capabilities.
- If affiliated with an academic institution, use an email address associated with the institution (ie. hosted on a "
  .edu" domain) during the registration.
- (Optional) Provide information about the nature of the anticipated work (eg. research topic, educational purpose,
  etc.)
- Agree to the conditions outlined below.

### 1.2. Applying for Free Compute.

As of now, no seprate application is needed. If you meet the eligibility criteria above, you can start using the
platform and its resources right away.

We will review the user base periodically and reach out to the users who meet the eligibility criteria to inform them
about the program and its benefits.

And consequently, we will screen out the users who do not meet the criteria.

2. For new users - submit a registration request using an email address associated with your academic institution
   include the information requested in **3**.
3. For existing users - if you use a personal email address during the registration, send an email to "
   support@mat3ra.com" from the email address associated with your academic institution (ie. hosted on a ".edu" domain)
   with a subject containing "Free Access for Academic Users"

we will review and enable access as appropriate. We will prioritize applications providing detailed information about
the applicants (ie. Google Scholar, ResearchGate profile(s), links to prior publications) and the nature of the
anticipated work.

## 3. Publicity.

We plan to select some of the work performed under the Free Compute Tier to be highlighted in the online
publication sources, similar to the below:

- [Enabling new Science through Accessible Cloud HPC](https://www.mat3ra.com/news-and-blog-posts/enabling-new-science-through-accessible-modeling-and-simulations)
- [Scientific Computing on Cloud Infrastructure](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/exabyteio-for-scientific-computing-on-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-hpc)

We will contact select users in advance to request permission for this. If you are interested in having your work
highlighted, please let us know by sending an email to `support@mat3ra.com`.

## 4. Feedback.

We welcome feedback from the users of the Community Programs listed here. Please send your feedback, suggestions, and
any issues you encounter to `support@mat3ra.com`.
