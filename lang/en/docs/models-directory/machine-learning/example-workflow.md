# Example Machine Learning Workflow

A Machine Learning [workflow](../../workflows/overview.md) may consist of the following multiple steps, performed in a
sequential order through the [units](../../workflows/components/units.md) specific to Machine Learning which are
described [in this page](units.md).

Below, we show an example implementation for both the training and prediction version of a workflow.

```json tab="Train"
{!example-json/machine-learning-train.json!}
```

```json tab="Predict"
{!example-json/machine-learning-predict.json!}
```
