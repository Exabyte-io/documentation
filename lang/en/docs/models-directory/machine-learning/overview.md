# Machine Learning Model

We introduce here the theoretical framework for **Machine Learning (ML)** [^1], a statistical learning method which can be used to create models based on the available data. ML models enable prediction of materials [properties](../../properties/overview.md), for example.

## [Parameters](parameters.md)

The list of parameters affecting ML is presented [in this page](parameters.md).

## [Properties](../../properties/classification/machine-learning.md)

We discuss the classification of properties in the context of ML in a [separate section](../../properties/classification/machine-learning.md) of the documentation.

## [Units](units.md)

We introduce some Machine Learning-specific [unit types](../../workflows/components/units.md) under [this explanation](units.md).

## [Structured Representation](data.md)

[This page](data.md) contains an example [structured representation](../../data-structured/overview.md) for the ML model.

## [Example Workflow](example-workflow.md)

We review [in this page](example-workflow.md) the structure of an example Machine Learning [workflow](../../workflows/overview.md).

## [Accuracy](accuracy.md)

We discuss in [this page](accuracy.md) several important considerations to make when deciding how accurate a machine-learned model is.
