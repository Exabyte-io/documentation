# External Uploads

In this section we review the concept of External Uploads that can contribute to the creation of [Entities](../entities-general/overview.md) within our platform.

External data, as it is clear from the name, originates outside of the Exabyte platform, and can be **organized** according to the classification employed within the platform. We introduce the concept of an External Upload - an operation where external data is uploaded to the platform and parsed.

## View Entities extracted from External Data

We associate the Entities (eg. Materials, Properties) extracted from external data within a single upload task with a [Job](../jobs/overview.md). And place each such job into a separate [project](../jobs/projects.md#external-project) called "External".

## [Status](status.md)

External Uploads have statuses attributed to them as explained [here](status.md).

## User Interface

### [Explorer](ui/explorer.md)

External Uploads Explorer is another specific implementation of the [Explorer](../entities-general/ui/explorer.md) component and is explained [in this page](ui/explorer.md). 

## [Actions](actions/overview.md)

Some actions pertain specifically to External Uploads, and are introduced [in this page](actions/overview.md).
