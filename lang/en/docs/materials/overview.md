# Materials

This section contains information about how we define, organize, store and interact with materials data and the corresponding properties. In a broad sense we consider Material to be a physical (chemical, biological) system(s) under investigation.

## User Interface

### [Materials Explorer](ui/explorer.md)

The implementation of the [Explorer Interface](../entities-general/ui/explorer.md) for Materials is explained [here](ui/explorer.md). 

### [Materials Designer](../materials-designer/overview.md)

**Materials Designer** is introduced [here](../materials-designer/overview.md), 

### [Materials Viewer](ui/viewer.md)

The **Viewer** interface and its differences from Designer are highlighted [separately](ui/viewer.md).

## [Actions](actions/overview.md)

The Actions section explains and provides visual examples of actions that users can perform on materials. These actions are introduced [in the following page](actions/overview.md).

## [Data](data.md)

The [Data](data.md) section contains an example of JSON representation of a material, with its detailed explanation.

## [Bank](bank.md)

[Materials Bank](bank.md) collection and its related operations is explained in the corresponding section. 

## Classification

Materials are distinguished based on whether they are [crystalline](classification/crystalline.md) and [non-periodic](classification/non-periodic.md). An overview of classifications can be found [here](classification/overview.md)

## [Properties](../properties/overview.md)

The [Properties](../properties/overview.md) section explains the general classification and contains examples of materials properties.
