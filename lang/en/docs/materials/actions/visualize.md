# Visualize Sets

[Sets](../../entities-general/sets.md) of material entries can be visualized by selecting the `Visualize` option <i class="zmdi zmdi-open-in-browser zmdi-hc-border"></i> under the [actions drop-down menu](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md#actions-dropdown) to the right of the set's entry within the materials [collection](../../accounts/collections.md), as viewed under the [Explorer Interface](../../entities-general/ui/explorer.md) of our platform.

This action allows the user to inspect the entire content of the set within a single instance of the [Materials Viewer interface](../ui/viewer.md).

## Animation

We demonstrate the procedure to visualize an example of [Interpolated Set](../../materials-designer/header-menu/advanced/interpolated-set.md), contained within an [ordered set](../../entities-general/sets.md#change-type) named "NEB set" in this case, in the following animation. We conclude the animation by cycling through the contents of the set, consisting in five different materials structures.
