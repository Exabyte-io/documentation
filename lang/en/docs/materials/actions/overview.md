# Materials-specific Actions

The following set of actions can be performed for Materials from the corresponding [Explorer Interface](../ui/explorer.md). They complement the actions of general applicability [introduced elsewhere](../../entities-general/actions/overview.md).

## [Advanced Search](advanced-search.md)

Materials stored in the Account-owned collection can be searched in an advanced manner as explained in [this page](advanced-search.md).

## [Import](import.md)

Additional materials can be imported from third-party online databases into the Account-owned collection by following [these instructions](import.md).

## [Upload](upload.md)

The user may also wish to upload new materials into the Account-owned collection directly from local files containing the relevant crystal structure data. Such process is explained [here](upload.md).

## [Set Default](set-default.md)

Setting a material as the default choice is mostly equivalent to the [general procedure](../../entities-general/actions/set-default.md) and is also reviewed [in this materials-specific page](set-default.md).

## [Copy Materials from Bank](copy-bank.md)

Copying Materials from the Bank is mostly equivalent to the procedure explained in [general introduction](../../entities-general/actions/copy-bank.md) and is also shown [here](copy-bank.md).

## [Visualize Sets](visualize.md)

[Sets](../../entities-general/sets.md) of materials can be visualized by performing the relevant [action](visualize.md).
