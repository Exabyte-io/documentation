# Materials Classifications

This section contains information about the different classification categories for materials within the platform. In a broad sense we consider [crystalline](crystalline.md) structures to be materials with uniform repeating units of atoms (i.e. quartz crystal) , [non-crystaline](non-crystalline.md) structures to be materials without a consistent arragement of atoms that can be broken down into repeating units (i.e. glass), and [non-periodic](non-periodic.md) structures to be considered as molecular structures, which consist of a smaller number of strongly bonded atoms. (i.e. methane) 

### [Crystalline](crystalline.md)
Crystaline structures have atoms arranged in such a way that their structure can be broken down into smaller repeating units. These materials can be truncated down to a single unit or a smaller subset of units for modeling purposes.

Crystalline structures are denoted by a <i class="zmdi zmdi-widget zmdi-hc-border"></i> icon.

**Example:** Crystalline Silica

Also known as Quartz, Chemical Formula SiO<sub>2</sub>.

Quartz has a uniform distribution of repeating SiO<sub>2</sub> units throughout its structure.

### [Non-Crystalline](non-crystalline.md)
Non-crystalline structures have atoms arranged in such a way that their structure cannot be broken down into smaller repeating units. Models of these systems need to include as many atoms as possible for improved accuracy of results.

Non-crystalline structures are denoted by a <i class="zmdi zmdi-widget zmdi-hc-border"></i> icon.

**Example** Non-Crystalline Silica

Also known as Glass, Chemical Formula SiO<sub>2</sub>.

Glass has a non-uniform distribution of uniform SiO<sub>2</sub> units throughout its structure.


### [Non-Periodic](non-periodic.md)
Non-periodic structures generally consist of a smaller number of atoms strongly bound together, i.e. molecular structures.

Non-Periodic structures are denoted by <i class="zmdi zmdi-device-hub zmdi-hc-border"></i> icons.

**Example** Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)

A methane molecule consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to four hydrogen atoms in a tetrahedral geometry. The H-C-H bond angles of methane are uniform at 109.5<sup>o</sup>. Each C-H bond has a uniform length of 1.09 Angstroms.

### Crystaline, Non-Crystalline and Non-Periodic [Materials Sets](../../entities-general/sets.md)

[Materials Sets](../../entities-general/sets.md) that consist of multiple structures grouped together for organizational purposes can be created for Crystaline, Non-Crystaline, and Non-periodic structures.

**Example** Materials Set of Non-Periodic Structures Describing a Reaction Trajectory

A materials set for a trajectory of non-periodic structures could be used to define a reaction path. Each structure within the set would represent a point along a bond forming and/or bond breaking reaction coordinate that describes the transformation of a reactant into an intermediate (or product).
