# Non-Periodic Materials

The complete **structure** of a **non-periodic chemcial system** is obtained from a [set of atoms](../../properties-directory/structural/non-periodic-basis.md), known as the **basis atoms**, that describe a set of non-repeating atoms that are held together by covalent or non-covalent interactions.  

This results in a structure with a specific geometry which gives it a defined [point-group](../../properties-directory/structural/point-group.md)[^2] symmetry assignment.

Examples of **non-periodic structures** include **molecules**[^1].
