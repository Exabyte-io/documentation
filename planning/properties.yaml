        - Overview
        # Properties (including tables)
            % Refer to the diagram explaining Material-Job-Property relation
            % Properties are extracted from the output of the simulations and presented to the user following the procedures and conventions outlined in the sections below (put links)
            % Properties are already implemented on our platform (and how to contribute new ones, soon-to-come feature) are explained in this section.
            % Mostly Materials properties here, however can be Workflow too - eg. convergence.
            % Present table of all the possbile properties

        - Extractors
        # Extraction of Raw Properties
            % Extraction of data consist in parsing the output data of simulation codes by post-processing software. Computational scientists are familiar with this concept and often have a set of scripts or "extractors". Our software does exactly that and forms structured data according to the Data Convention (Schemas) to subsequently store properties in the database.
            % For example, the retrieveal of the total energy in a Quantum Espresso output file can be done by looking for the "!" character, and extracting the ensuing content of the same line. Alternatively, a corresponding XML file can be parsed.
        # User-defined Extractors
            % We plan to allow users to write their own extractor scripts to extract new properties, and share such scripts with other users

        - Refinement
        # Refinement of Computed Properties
            % Once extracted from the output files, some properties might need to be refined in order to be made presentable to the user
            % This refinement selection is done based on how physically meaningful such properties are
        # Raw
            % Raw properties are all properties extracted from the output files of simulation codes, ragardless of how much physical sense they make
        # Refined
            % Refined properties include those properties which are physically meaningful
            NOTE TO GM from TB - The Total Energy is Stored as Refined Actially:
            % For the [pseudopotential DFT] the Fermi Energy for example is excluded from being classed as Refined, since its absolute value makes no physical meaning and depends on method used and XC functional approximation
            % The band gap instead is considered a refined property since it is a relative energy difference, and therefore its computed value can be compared directly with experiments
        # Best
            % Best is defined as the computation of a given refined materials property which has achieved the best precision, out of all the computations performed across the Exabyte platform by all users
            % Put link to precision explain

        - User Interface
            - Properties Explorer
            NOTE TO GM from TB - We should stop speaking about where the explorer can be found inside explorer pages themselves. Below the Viewer is where we should refer to Properties Explorer instead:
            # Properties Explorer
                % The properties explorer interface can be found at the bottom of the materials viewer page
                % It displays all the computed properties associated with the material being currently inspected
            # Specific Features
                % Specific features include the properties which can be displayed under the table columns of the interface

            - Final Structure Viewer
            # Materials Viewer for Final Structure
                % The final computed structure of the corresponding simulation unit can be inspected under a Materials Viewer interface inside the Results Tab of the Jobs Viewer. This is handy for the runs that include structural relaxation.
            # Link to main Viewer documentation
                % Materials Viewer is explained in detail separately (put link)

            - Energies
            # Total Energy,

            # Average pressure

            - Lists of scalars
            NOTE TO GM from TB - this is not a scalar, but a list of scalars:
            # Total Energy Contributions

        - Array/Vector
            NOTE TO GM from TB - Total Force is not a scalar:
            - Total force
            - Stress tensor
