        # Classtification of Data Types
            % We classify data according to the following different conventions (put links to their dedicated sections below, with a short description)
        # Structured
            % We explain how we store entities as JSON structured representations here (put link)
        # Disk
            % This explanation is relevant for data stored on cluster disks, and not stored in objects for viewing under web app (yet), according to the lifecycle introduced in the next section 
        # Object 
            % Relevant for files stored as objects to be viewed under web app.
        # Links
            % (Wikipedia/Web) links explaining structured and non-structured data concepts, object storage

        - Lifecycle      
        # Data Lifecycle
            % Explain the general flow:
                - User Actions in Web Application created structured data in database (Entities)
                - These Entities are sent to the computational infrastructure [link] to create non-structured data during simulations
                - Data is stored on disk and Object storage to make it accessible to Web Application again
        # Flowchart
            % Put lifecycle flowchart (see notebook)
