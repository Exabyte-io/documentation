        - Overview
        # Object Storage
            % General introduction to Object Storage concept for storing and transferring unstructured data
            % We can store data in the form of objects, and access them on webapp as "Files" in the UI
            % Put links to the dedicated explanation pages in the sections below

        - Files
        # Files
            % General introduction to Files concept as objects in Object Storage
            % We organize our simulation data under files in order to interact with the simulation engines, both for inputting parameters and getting the output of the calculation
        # Directory Structure (link to Data on Disk)
            % Files are organized under a directory Structure
            % Put link to Data on Disk section explaining the directory structure

        - Dropbox    
        # Dropbox
            % Dropbox is implemneted through Object Storage and connects Data on Disk with it
            % Dropbox is a general utility storage system that is mounted on all nodes on our infrastructure and can be used to share files everywhere across the platform
        # Diagram (Flowchart with dropbox at the centre)
            % This is a list of all nodes where Dropbox is mounted
            % Put flowchar to explain above list better

        - User Interface
            - Files Tab 
            # "Symlink" to Files Tab in jobs viewer

            - Files Explorer
            # Files Explorer
                % It displays both the input and output files of the simulation
                % Include screenshot of its appearance
