        # Jobs via Command Line Interface
            % This section explain how simulatin Jobs can be created and executed via CLI - put link to main CLI section and Jobs section
            % put links to the below
        # Batch script
        # NOTE: Accessing data in Web Interface
            % Jobs created through command-line Interface will still show up in the web Interface for user convenience under the corresponding project as indicated in the [batch script]
            % When experiencing problems, this feature can be disabled by a flag in the batch script (To be clarified which exact flag)

        - Accounting
            - Balance
            # Overview
                % In order to perform computations a greater than zero balance is required (link to Accounts/Balance)
                % We make balance for each account accessible through CLI. Members of organizational accounts can access the corresponding balance.
            # View Account Balance
                % The account balance (put link to accounts) can be inspected with the following command (put an example)

            - Statement command
            # Overview
                We track usage, or balance spent on computations per each account AND each project.
            # View Usage Statistics
                % The usage statistics of each cluster, in terms of number of CPU hours consumed and charges incurred, can be inspected with the following command under CLI
            # Examples
                % Provide examples on how to access balance for the following distinct scenarios: for the last month, for a specific account, and for specific project.
                $ Explain how to view all options to "statement" command

        - Actions
            - Create
            # Create New Job
                % A new Job can be created by assembling all simulation input files and batch script together in the same folder under the cluster home directory
                % Novice users can use "job_script_templates" directory
                % NOTE: be deliberate when setting walltime, b/c
                    - jobs that require long walltime will [reserve] balance so other jobs won't be able to start
                    - when not enough walltime is allocated jobs may not finish
                    - submit support ticket (in advance) if a walltime adjustment is needed (we'll try our best to accommodate depending on the load and business hours)

            - Submit
            # Submit Job
                % A job can then be submitted to the relevant queue for its execution with the qsub command
                % Explain that the directory has to be under "cluster-00?" folder and the ? will determine which cluster it will be executed on.

            - Check status
            # Check status of Job
                % The status of the job can be checkd at any moment with the qstat command
                % Possible statuses might include Running, Pending, Error, Aborted etc....
                % Explain how to understand which cluster the job is executed on

            - Terminate
            # Terminate
                % A Job might be terminated intentionally by the user before its completion with the qdel command
