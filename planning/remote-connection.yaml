        # Remote Connection Methods
            % We offer alternative methods to submit jobs to the supercomputing clusters and access the associated data other than the Web App
            % These methods offer either a CLI or remote desktop environment
            % The avialble options are the following - put links
        # SSH Terminal
        # Web Terminal
        # Remote Desktop
            % NOTE: explan that the two above are via Guacamole server

            % to Guacamole Server, SSH



        - SSH Terminal (SSH)
        NOTE TO GM FROM TB - this page seems to long, maybe we should split:
        # Connect to CLI with SSH Terminal
            % To connect to the CLI, an external SSH terminal client can be used under any OS instead of the Web Terminal
            % Experienced users can go directly to "Upload SSH key" section.
        # OS-specific SSH Clients
            % We recommend the following clients for each OS
        ## Putty for Windows
            % Putty is a widespread SSH client for Windows - put link to homepage
        ## OpenSSH for Unix
            % OpenSSH is the standard protocol in Unix-based OSs for connecting through SSH via the terminal
        # Generate SSH Keys
            % SSH keys are necessary to connect to the CLI using your Exabyte account credentials
            % Instructions on how to generate such keys can be found below for different clients
        ## Putty
            % Instructions for Putty can be found here - put link to online tutorial
        ## OpenSSH
            % Instructions for Unix can be found here - put link to online tutorial
        # Upload SSH key
            % After generting the keys, they need to be uploaded to oour platform and associated with your account via Preferneces
            % This establishes a secure link between the external SSH client and your Exabyte account
            % We explain how to upload the SSH keys generated in the previous step to our platform in a separate section - put link to accounts preferences page
        # Connect to Server
            % Once the secure SSH link is established via the keys, the remote Exabyte server (bohr) can be accessed as follows - put full address of bohr server
        # Enter CLI (link)
            % Following successful SSH connection, the user is presented with the CLI of our platform - put link to main CLI section
            % Some useful instructions are already contained in the splash welcome screen - put a copy of this welcome message (screenshot)
        # Transfer files with SCP
            % To transfer files back and forth from your local drives to your folders on the remote Exabyte server, we recommend the SCP protocol, which is also based on SSH
        ## Windows Instructions
            % On Windows, we recommend the WinSCP program - put lin kto onlien tutorials
        ## Unix Instructions
            % On Unix, SCP file transfers can be performed directly via terminal with the following commands - put link to online tutorials
        # Links to clients documentation
            % Put links to all mentioned clients and tutorials here


        - Web Terminal (WT)
        # Connect to CLI with Web Terminal
            % Alternatively to external SSH clients, the CLI can also be accessed through a Web Terminal incorporared on our platform, so user doesn't have to install any extra Software
        # Enter CLI (link)
            % After entering the Web Terminal, the user is welcomed with the following CLI - put link to main CLI section and screenshot
        # Open (link to action)
            % We explain how to open the Web Terminal here - put link to Actions page


        - Remote Desktop (RD)
        # Connect to Exabyte Platform via Remote Desktop
            % If the user prefers a graphical desktop environment to CLI, a remote desktop option is also avialble to connect to our infrastructure
        # Linux Environment (Link to CentOS documentation)
            % This Remote Desktop environment is based on CentOS linux - put link to official page and documentation
        # Available Analysis Software (link)
            % The following set of Analysis Software is avaible in remote desktop, in their GUI versions - put table with links to main software pages
            % We explain how to open such software here - put link to actions.
        # Open (link to action)
            % We explain how to open remote desktop here - put link to actions page
