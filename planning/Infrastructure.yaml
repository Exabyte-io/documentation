- Overview
    # Introduction to Infrastructure
        % Our platform is a comprehensive distributed web application.
        % This section explains the main important parts of its computational infrastructure (as opposed to the web Interface explained in other parts of this documentation)
        % For expert in computational science we support platform-level access with ability to submit
            simulation jobs to computing clusters via alternative connection methods (put link to connection methods section)
        % The different components are connected as follows - put complete flowchart of infrastructure
        % Clicking on each component leads to corresponding documentation page

    # Logic Node
    # Clusters
    # Resource Management
    # User Interface



- Storage System
    # Storage System
        % We allow for the storage of simulation data on hard drives connected to the clusters
        % We explain the storage of simulation files on disks in this section - put link to "data on disks" section

        % The storage system is explained in the flowchart included here (see notebook)
    # Storage Quotas
        % This storage space is subject to certain quotas, as explained here - put link

- Login Node
    - Overview
    # Login Node
        NOTE TO GM FROM TB - users are NOT SUPPOSED to access clusters directly, you should make it clear:
        % When the user first logs in using either the remote desktop or terminals (put links below), he/she will be directed first to his/her home folder under the login Node, instead of accessing the clusters directly
        % The Login node is the access point to clusters, and is organized according to the directory structure explained below
    # Connection Options
    # Directory Structure

    - Connection Options
    # Connection Options
        % The login node can be accessed via any of the following connection methods
    # SSH Terminal (link to section under Remote Connection)
        % The user can use an external SSH client under any OS to connect to our CLI. We explain how to do so in this page - put link to main SSH page
    # Web Terminal
        % Alternatively, we offer an incorporated Terminal within our Web App which also takes the user to the CLI - put link to main Web Terminal page
        % It can be accessed via the right-hand sidebar - put link
    # Remote Desktop
        % If the user wants to experience a fully graphical desktop environment, he can do so via the Remote Desktop App - put link to main page
        % It can also be accessed via the right-hand sidebar - put link

    - Directory Structure
    # Important Directories under Home folder (flowchart)
        % Once the user enters his/her home folder under the login node via any of the possible connection methods, he/she will be presented with the following directory structure
        % Put flowchart of important folders within the level of the login home (no sub folders for the moment)
    # Clusters home folders (link to dir structure section under Clusters)
        % Each cluster has its own distinct home folder
        % We explain the contents of these clusters homes in a separate section - put link to next section.
    # Dropbox (link to Data Disk)
        % Dropbox is a convenient way of sharing and tranferring files across the infrastructure - put link to main Dropbox page under Data on Disk
    # Jobscript Templates (link to Data Disk)
        % Login Home also contains a folder with Job script examples, for submitting jobs via CLI - put link
        % This folder is explained in detail here - put link to data on disk

####################################################################################################################################

- Clusters
    - Overview
    # Clusters
        % We offer a set of high-performance computing clusters for performing material modeling simulations in a massively parallel fashion.
        % These clusters are part of the computing cloud infrastructures offered by various providers
        % Clusters also offer a certain amount of storage space for storing simulation data, subject to certain quotas as explained here - put link
        % The architecture of an individual cluster is explained in the diagram below
        % Mention Benchmarks
    # Architecture Diagram
    # Directory Structure (link)
    # Cloud Providers (links)
    ## Private Enterprise Clusters
    ## Direct SSH to cluster

    - Directory Structure
    # Important Directories under Cluster Home folder (flowchart)
        % The following directories are present under the home folder of each cluster
        % Put tree diagram for cluster home
    # Personal Account Data (link to Data Disk)
        % Each user has a personal data folder associated with his own personal account - put link to data on disks main explanation
    # Organization Shared Data (link to Data Disk)
        % Members of an Organization can all share data together via the shared folder - put link to data on disks main explanation
    # Termporary Data (/tmp folder)
        % Personal Accounts can also share data between them, without beloning to an Organization, via the tmp folder
        % Warning - the data in tmp is temporary and not guaranteed to be saved for a long time - use with caution or consider upgrading

    # TODO: MM to add content
    # Explain the hardware offered by each cloud provider

####################################################################################################################################

- Resource Management
    - Overview
    # Resource Management
        % The cluster computational resources are managed according to a Resource Management system (put a link to PBS/Torque 6.0.0 and to its PDF guide available in Google Drive)
        % Queues are used to allow for the efficient distribution of resources themselved administered by a task scheduler software (Maui + Exacluster)
        % When a job is submitted to any of the queues, the cloud scheduler is responsible for provisioning computational nodes and allocating resources on them for the jobs
        NOTE TO GM FROM TB - do not use CPU resources:
        % Waiting times might be incurred by the user depending of the availability of computing resources and the priority of the job in the queue
    # Category
    # Queues

    - Category
    # Resource Categories
        % Different speed categories are available at different prices, depending on the urgency of the job that needs submitting
        % Put link to the service levels pages for pricing information
    # Ordinary
        % Meant as the common "workhorse" option. Price in [service levels] is shown for this Category
        % The options below have different Charge factors
    # Debug
        NOTE TO GM FROM TB - how did you come up with the "cheap" below????:
        % Debug is fast to execute, but contains limited resources - only good for preliminary testing and debugging of simulations
    ## Saving
        TODO by GM - explan this section:
    # Fast
        % Fast access to computational resources for urgent jobs, but more expensive to use. The option to use GPUs is also offered here for better performance
        % The options below have different Charge factors
    ## Ordinary
    ## Fast
    ## GPU
    # Premium
        % Our infrastructure includes multiple compute clusters at a time, with some providing premium performance.
        % Premium hardware has an extra charge factor

    - Queues
    # Queues
        % Different queues are available under each category, affording for different amounts of computational resources (number of cores)
    # Available Options (Table)
        % Here we present a table of all the possible queue options, with an indication of how many CPU cores are available under each of them
