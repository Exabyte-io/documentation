        - Directory Structure (central explanation)
        # Directory Structure
            % We organize these files under a certain directory structure, as explained below
            % Put links to login node directory structure and cluster directory structure pages

            % Explain Mapping of folders from Clusters to Login node
        # Permissions
            % We organize our directories under a Linux filesystem where standard permssions apply
        # Login Home
            % Navigate to Cluster Home directories to run any Jobs
            % Once the user logins, he will enter the home directory under the login node
            % Put links to login node in infrastructure
            % Link to Quota
        # Cluster Home
            % Under login home, the homes of each cluster can be accessed under cluster alias name
            % Put links to Cluster infrastructure page 
            % Link to Quota
        # Dropbox
            % Dropbox is a folder mounted on all nodes, allowing data and files to be shared across the platform

        - Quotas
        # Storage Quota
            % We apply storage quotas to both home and shared folders on clusters - Put a link to general quota page under accounts section 
            % This limits the amount of storage space that can be consumed by user or Organization 
            % Hard quota, soft quota (we set hard quota only)
            % Put a link to CLI command to check quotas
        # Login Node Home
            % Small quota for source code, scripts only
            % Mention that python packages can be run inside this folder
            % The quota under the home folder is a certain amount of Gb
        # Cluster Home directory
            % The quota under the home folder is a certain amount of Gb
        # Shared Folder
            % The quota under the shared folder is a certain amount of Gb
