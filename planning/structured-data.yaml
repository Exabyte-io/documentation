        - Overview  
        # Structured Data
            % We can store entity-related data as structured JSON representations 
            % This structured data can be calssified in different ways, as explained below 
            % Present summary table of all classification types, like in the existing documentation page
            % See existing documentation page for adding content to the below sections 
        # Classification
        ## By Entity Type 
            % put links to entity-specific data pages
        ### Materials
        ### Workflows
        ### Jobs
        ## By data type
        ### Scalar
            % Any quantity which is presented as a scalar, e.g. energy
        ## By relation to workflow
        ### Descriptive
            % Materials properties which can be computed before the execution of any Job on them, simply using their structural parameters (e.g. Volume and density)
        ### Characteristic
            % Materials properties which instead require computational jobs in order to be computed, like energy or pressure 
        ## By meaning
        ### Physical
            % Any physcially meaningful quantity (e.g. band gap, because it's a relative energy difference)
        ### Auxiliary
            % Computed properties which depend on DFT parameters and are therefore not physically meaningful (e.g. absolute value of total energy)
